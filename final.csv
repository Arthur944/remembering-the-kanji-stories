一;one;In Chinese characters, the number **one** is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right.;* As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of _floor_ or _ceiling_ , depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means _ceiling_ , if below, _floor_.;1) [[Piitaa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa)] 29-6-2006(263): **One** down, 2041 to go. ,).;2) [[findus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus)] 11-5-2008(98): To learn this **one** kanji, I [recommend](../v4/2000.html) (#2000 薦) this story : _Bambi_ is in a _cave_ , eating a side-dish of _salad_ when trying to learn the kanjis. As he succeed to learn the kanji for "one", you get jealous and decide to shoot him with a _slingshot_. At this moment you hear the police coming, so you hurriedly burn all the proofs into a _fire_ (so you remove the key-words _Bambi_ , _slingshot_ and _fire_ from _recommend_ ). So that when the police arrives, the only remaining clue is a single horizontal bar.;3) [[diracbracket](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket)] 27-2-2008(93): This **one** is too difficult to remember. If the other Kanji are this difficult, I'm giving up.;4) [[breton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/breton)] 10-10-2007(44): A sleeping Roman I. ,).;5) [[MeisterLlama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama)] 29-4-2009(36): Tips for your journey:1)check the keywords (for example with saiga-jp kanji dict or jisho.org or <http://dic.yahoo.co.jp> \+ rikaichan). heisig messes up a lot. 2)you'll get mixed up if you use too many penis euphemisms. i try to stick with just "crotch" for penis. 3)try to use the right meaning of the keyword in your stories. for example 抄 "extract" is like an excerpt, not the verb extract.
二;two;Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for **two** is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter.;;1) [[kiisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu)] 15-1-2008(54): **Two** lines.;2) [[mazel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel)] 10-9-2006(24): Roman numeral II, written on its side.;3) [[FuDaWei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FuDaWei)] 20-8-2009(22): No wonder the hotel room only cost **TWO** yen, all it had was a _ceiling_ and a _floor_.;4) [[findus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus)] 11-12-2007(14): With this one, I have doubled the number of kanjis I know. Next please ,).;5) [[sakurasan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sakurasan)] 27-4-2008(7): 1+1 = 2.
三;three;And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for **three** simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of "1 + 2 = 3" (一 + 二 = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(68): One + two = **three**.;2) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 26-5-2009(49): **THREE** measurements define the female shape: BUST, WAIST, and HIPS. Waist is the smallest, and for most women the HIPS are wider than the chest.;3) [[Kylecito](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kylecito)] 22-12-2008(15): A **three** some: a Roman girl getting sandwitched by two blokes yelling "me too!" (みつ).;4) [[cactus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cactus)] 11-3-2008(10): A Roman family sleeping together horizontally.Can't you see the kid between his parents?;5) [[mazel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel)] 16-4-2008(9): One ( 一 ) on top of two ( 二 ), gives **three** ( 三 ).
四;four;This character is composed of two primitive elements, _mouth_ and _human legs_ , both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the "story" connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top- to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast.;;1) [[tomb771](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomb771)] 9-2-2007(115): **FOUR** year-olds often put their FOOT (human legs) in their MOUTH - but they are too young to realize.;2) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 21-3-2007(42): I imagine a giant devouring a human in **four** bites. First the giant bites off the person's head, then he bites the torso, then from the waist to the knees, and finally the giant plucks up the remaining portion of the human legs into his mouth. See the **four** th bite falling in there?;3) [[kanji55](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanji55)] 29-4-2008(36): This is a picture of a slab in the morgue. It is pulled out from the drawer, and it is showing only the dead person's feet. Clearly _shi_ means DEATH.;4) [[xiteru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru)] 9-10-2007(22): A man inside **four** walls.;5) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 16-12-2007(19): **Four** are the _legs_ of the Schrödinger Cat, which is kept in a _box_ , and you don't know if the cat is dead or alive until you open it.
五;five;As with _four_ , we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for **five**.;;1) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 11-4-2008(236): 三 + two vertical lines = 5.;2) [[Branduil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil)] 25-2-2006(36): This Kanji looks like a "3" Kanji with two added vertical lines. 3+2= 5.;3) [[gaijingo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijingo)] 16-6-2006(33): **Five** \- has a THREE, and a small 'h'… 'high **five** '.;4) [[verne710](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/verne710)] 10-7-2009(13): The letter 'F' is skiing for the 'five' trophies.;5) [[overture2112](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/overture2112)] 8-11-2010(7): The _King_ ([king](../v4/255.html) (#255 王)) leaned on the magical _walking stick_ in his left hand which the wizard said would let him "go" (ゴ) through the **fifth** dimension.
六;six;The primitives here are _top hat_ and _animal legs_. Once again, we glide over them until later.;;1) [[Andre_Breton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Andre_Breton)] 5-12-2007(127): Indicating 6 parts of the human body: head, body, 2 arms, 2 legs.;2) [[Jeromin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin)] 22-12-2008(69): The Devil, always a gentleman, wears a top hat, but his goat legs, betray the Beast. 666 is his number.;3) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 21-3-2007(41): **Six** -Six-SIX ((666)) Mark of the Beast!! Imagine that dapper old beastly fellow summoning his top hat to himself. See it scamper over to him on a little pair of beastly legs.;4) [[FuDaWei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FuDaWei)] 24-5-2010(15): Someone lying spread-eagle, ready for "sex" ( **SIX** ). —or— Hey, everyone! Come see! I just trapped a **SIX** -inch gremlin under my _top-hat_!;5) [[fesgo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fesgo)] 2-2-2008(12): The **six** members of a person, however the torso was eat by the devil (666).
七;seven;Note that the first stroke "cuts" through the second. This distinguishes **seven** from the character for _spoon_  (Frame 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short.;* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of _diced_ , i.e., "cut" into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for _cut_ to be learned in a later lesson (Frame 89).;1) [[munia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia)] 15-11-2005(243): This kanji is our good old **seven** , turned upside down.;2) [[Angrybeez](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez)] 10-6-2008(68): I wrote it upside down so I crossed it out.;3) [[fesgo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fesgo)] 2-2-2008(23): Almost katakana SE = **SEVEN**.;4) [[keller97](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/keller97)] 15-12-2011(13): I _crossed_ it out because I wrote this **SEVEN** _upside down_.;5) [[michael](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/michael)] 27-8-2007(13): If you take the line in the middle out, it's an upside down **seven** , Ta-da!
八;eight;Just as the Arabic numeral "8" is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for **eight** is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the  "lazy 8" is the mathematical symbol for "infinity," so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something "all-encompassing.";;1) [[clemk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/clemk)] 18-6-2006(120): "Hachi" (eight) begins with the sound of the **katakana "ha"** , and it's approximately the same character.;2) [[Rose_Arteth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rose_Arteth)] 17-8-2007(65): The valcano hasn't erupted for 8 years.;3) [[DeeLoli](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeeLoli)] 26-10-2008(20): The curtains close at **eight**.;4) [[jmehr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmehr)] 1-9-2008(16): I **eight** something so large, it bent my chopsticks.;5) [[Angrybeez](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Angrybeez)] 21-8-2008(15): I **eight** a volcano! now I got heart burn.
九;nine;If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for _power_ (Frame 922).;* As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean _baseball team_ or simply _baseball_. The meaning, of course, is derived from the _nine_ players who make up a team.;1) [[joeyjpm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joeyjpm)] 15-7-2008(161): _Warning - naughty reminder_ A woman in the doggie style position, waiting for my **NINE** inches.;2) [[Gunii](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gunii)] 12-2-2008(157): Kinda of looks like the kanji of 1 一 with the kanji of 8 八 added. So think of it as [一＋八＝九](midori://search?text=一＋八＝九) .;3) [[sharpstick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sharpstick)] 9-6-2007(50): It looks like an elaborate letter "n" for **nine**.;4) [[CaptainN](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CaptainN)] 17-10-2008(24): Girl waiting in doggy-style position for her boyfriend. If only she knew back then she would get pregnant and would have to carry a baby for **nine** months!;5) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 28-10-2007(21): **Nine** baseball players, bowing low on the ground on hands and knees, before the game starts. おねがいします！.
十;ten;Turn this character 45 degrees either way and you have the x used for the Roman numeral **ten**.;* As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of _ten_ and sometimes signifies _needle_ , this latter derived from the kanji for _needle_ (Frame 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(68): Two needles crossing marks the spot, or you can use the Roman character for **ten** (rotated 45 degrees).;2) [[naur_caraniril](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/naur_caraniril)] 11-10-2008(47): I scared away **ten** vampires with a single cross!;3) [[vgambit](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit)] 23-6-2007(23): **Ten** looks like a plus sign.;4) [[fernglas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fernglas)] 2-3-2009(21): A roman **ten** (X) standing on one leg.;5) [[Kaithegreat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kaithegreat)] 31-7-2009(10): T for **ten**.
口;mouth;Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for **mouth** is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.;* As a primitive, this form also means _mouth_. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests - an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head - can be used for the primitive meaning.;1) [[currynrice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/currynrice)] 30-6-2007(110): Looks like a huge open **mouth**.;2) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 8-11-2008(21): When you sneeze, your **MOUTH** forms a square, and you make a noise that sounds like (KUCHI).;3) [[GrimPanda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GrimPanda)] 27-9-2010(17): If you say "kuchi" one more time, I'm going to _box_ you in the **mouth**. ("kuchi" is how your pronounce this kanji, box is the memory symbol ).;4) [[DaveNelms](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DaveNelms)] 19-7-2007(10): Momma used to say: "Keep your trap shut!" This thing is shaped like a trap door.;5) [[Chugoku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chugoku)] 7-8-2011(6): Sponge Bob Square **Mouth**.
日;day;This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun - like those yellow badges with the words, "Have a nice **day**! ";* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean _sun_ or _day_ or a _tongue wagging in the mouth_. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like  "sayeth" and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Frame 620).;1) [[Alphinux](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alphinux)] 23-1-2008(120): Open the window, new **day**.;2) [[ibnfe2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ibnfe2)] 30-12-2006(18): Picture two halves of a 24-hr period: **Day** & Night.;3) [[ruschein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein)] 4-1-2009(11): Open window because its a _sunny_ **day**.;4) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 29-10-2007(11): On Sun **day** , church-goers sings hymns, their _tongues wagging in their mouths_.;5) [[pilot_sun16](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pilot_sun16)] 28-1-2010(10): =sun, **day** ： Each time the SUN rises a new **DAY** begins. [day](../v4/12.html) (#12 日) is a picture of the sun. Normally we draw the sun with a circle(ㅇ) surrounded by many strokes. But there are no “round” shaped Kanji so we take [mouth](../v4/11.html) (#11 口) instead, and one stroke in the middle (one (#1 一)) representing all. 日本 Japan, 日曜日 （ニチジヨウび）Sunday, 毎日 （マイニチ）everyday, 母の日 （ははのひ）mother's **day** , 日記 （ニッキ）diary, 三日 （ミッカ）three **day** s.
月;month;This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical "man in the moon." (Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one **month** , of course, is one cycle of the moon.;* As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of _moon_ , _flesh_ , or _part of the body_. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.;1) [[cerulean](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean)] 19-5-2008(157): A **month** is longer than a day.;2) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 21-3-2007(60): Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air "mooning" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of **month** , considering that **month** s were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon. Also, the mooning "ass" part of it connects well to Hesig's seemingly unconnected "flesh" or "part of the body" meaning (when used in primitive form).;3) [[gaijingo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijingo)] 16-6-2006(15): **Month** \- every MOON cycle, werewolves eat FLESH, and other PARTs OF THE BODY.;4) [[Tsuki56](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki56)] 6-6-2009(12): Once a **month** , the moon is full.;5) [[LiviaCH](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LiviaCH)] 5-8-2008(8): A **month** is longer than a day.
田;rice field;Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird's-eye view of a **rice field** divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in frame 4.;* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of _rice field_ is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of _brains_ from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.;1) [[Chisaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chisaku)] 30-6-2007(114): A **rice field** divided into four parts.;2) [[Kosmo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kosmo)] 17-5-2008(41): _Ten_ people use their _mouths_ to eat the yield of the **rice fields**.;3) [[ruschein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein)] 4-1-2009(30): _Ten_ **rice field** s can feed many _mouths_.;4) [[chrisgaunt](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chrisgaunt)] 3-1-2011(16): A farmer must use his _brain_ to measure out a 4-plot **rice field**.;5) [[mikan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikan)] 16-12-2007(11): One day the farmer is neatly digging his **rice field** chopping down with his spade in two directions at 90 degrees, when suddenly there is a crunching sound as he has chopped twice into the skull of a dead body exposing the **brain** s sliced into four pieces. Ughhh !
目;eye;Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an **eye**.;* As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of _eye_ , or more specifically, an _eyeball_. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side.;1) [[d3kuma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/d3kuma)] 13-7-2009(223): 目 _ 目 .;2) [[kylemanning](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kylemanning)] 22-11-2007(92): There are 3 sections. Imagine the outer two being the whites of your **eye**. The middle is the pupil. Fill it in with imaginary color.;3) [[xiteru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru)] 9-10-2007(20): This one comes from an ancient character that was an **eye**. It is an **eye** rotated in 90 degree but got squared (think about anime style **eye** s).;4) [[TakaTahuNuva](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TakaTahuNuva)] 29-3-2009(12): 目 _ 目 .;5) [[MechHawk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MechHawk)] 30-9-2009(6): ( 目 _ 目 ).
古;old;The primitive elements that compose this character are _ten_ and _mouth_ , but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with **old** inscriptions on the tombstones. This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character  "drawings.";* Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of _old_ , but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.;1) [[Thaliel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thaliel)] 8-7-2006(191): Tombstone and cross on an **old** man's grave.;2) [[rajivp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rajivp)] 31-10-2007(76): You get **OLD** fast if you have ten open mouths to feed.;3) [[deusclivio](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/deusclivio)] 7-1-2009(39): **Old** people tend to talk a lot. Almost as if they had TEN MOUTHS!;4) [[MatthewThomas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MatthewThomas)] 14-1-2008(22): The **old** man had only _10_ teeth in his _mouth_.;5) [[gfb345](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345)] 13-6-2010(14): A story is **OLD** when it has been told by _TEN MOUTH_ s.
吾;I;There are actually a number of kanji for the word **I** , but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the "perceiving subject." Now the one place in our bodies that all _five_ senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than _five mouths_ : 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, _five mouths_ = **I**.;;1) [[kbaum](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kbaum)] 18-7-2007(170): I have 5 senses.;2) [[AxelFoe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AxelFoe)] 12-11-2007(139): I eat five times at day.;3) [[SketchySolid](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SketchySolid)] 10-7-2009(53): **I** consist of _five_ senses to observe, one _mouth_ to speak. _For order, remember that observing through the senses should be done before using one's mouth_.;4) [[Lbear](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lbear)] 26-7-2007(41): I have two eyes, nose, two ears = 5 plus one mouth.;5) [[Plathix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Plathix)] 30-9-2008(32): I can fit all five of my fingers in my mouth! :D.
冒;risk;Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the _sun_ for fear you might burn out your _eyes_? Probably you were foolish enough to **risk** a quick glance once or twice, but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a _sun_ above and an _eye_ right below looking up at it has the meaning of **risk** (see frame 12).;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(283): Don't look at the sun directly with your eyes, it's **risk** y!;2) [[godcomplex](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/godcomplex)] 2-11-2007(55): You'll **risk** your eyesight if you look up at the sun.;3) [[laner36](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laner36)] 19-5-2008(31): Looking up at the big sun is a **risk** to your eye. To remember that the sun primitive is bigger than the eye primitive, imagine making your eyes little (squinting) when you go out in the bright sun to reduce the **risk** of getting sun blindness. READING: imagine a kid saying "oh that's ぼう (bull as in B.S.), looking at the sun is no **risk**!" [he's blind now].;4) [[cerulean](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cerulean)] 19-5-2008(14): Staring into the big _sun_ can **risk** your _eye_ sight! HINT: It looks like a pipe from Super Mario Bros. It might be **risk** y to go down it. :p.;5) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-9-2007(10): If you look at the _sun_ high in the sky directly with your _eyes_ below, you're taking a big **risk**.
朋;companion;The first **companion** that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam exclaimed,  " _Flesh_ of my _flesh_! " And that is precisely what this character says in so many strokes.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(136): My **companion** and I are like two moons side by side.;2) [[kylemanning](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kylemanning)] 22-11-2007(60): One moon is lonely. Two moons are **companion** s.;3) [[lucianreign](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign)] 15-11-2006(47): Under the twin moons of Tatooine, Luke had no **COMPANION**.;4) [[xombijosh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xombijosh)] 10-3-2008(36): Two bodies next to each other, **companion** s.;5) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 7-1-2008(18): Real **companion** s stay together during dark times, under many MOONS, or many MONTHS…
明;bright;Among nature's **bright** lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the _sun_ to rule over the day and the _moon_ to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common connotations of this key word: the _sun_ , the **bright** insight of the clear thinker, and the _moon_ , the **bright** intuition of the poet and the seer (see frame 13).;;1) [[ablindmouse](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ablindmouse)] 28-8-2007(330): The sun makes the moon **bright**.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(58): The sun and the moon are **bright** est objects in the day and night, respectively.;3) [[snispilbor](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snispilbor)] 15-4-2008(39): In the long run, the REAL trouble here is distinguishing it from "shining"/"sparkle". Choose a story to learn how to write 明 . To distinguish it, remember the Japanese word 明日 (ashita, "tomorrow") and think of Orphan Annie singing " _Tomorrow_ is a **bright** er day".;4) [[henroski](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/henroski)] 24-8-2008(19): The SUN is **BRIGHT** ER than the MOON.;5) [[geekdiva](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/geekdiva)] 30-11-2005(8): About the order of the primitives: The phrase that I usually hear is "the sun and moon," so to help me remember the order, I'll remember that phrase. Oh! Better yet, I'll put them _in order of **bright** ness_.
唱;chant;This one is easy! You have one _mouth_ making no noise (the choirmaster) and two _mouths with wagging tongues_ (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, **chant** , as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 11).;;1) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 29-6-2007(201): Someone **chant** ing with their mouth open for two consecutive days.;2) [[Tanuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tanuki)] 5-8-2007(50): **Chant** s from our mouths are meant to reach the sun and the stars. Stars are just suns just further away so they seem smaller.;3) [[arturo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arturo)] 14-7-2007(33): His _mouth_ **chant** s always when _prosperous_.;4) [[MichaelAnd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MichaelAnd)] 10-3-2008(28): The monk opened his month and **chant** ed for two days.;5) [[rowdyphantom](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom)] 23-2-2010(16): A yogi opens his _mouth_ and **chant** s for _two straight days_! [So, did you reach nirvana? "Nah, got a wicked sore throat, though."].
晶;sparkle;What else can the word **sparkle** suggest if not a diamond? And if you've ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature _sun_. This kanji is a picture of a tiny _sun_ in three places (that is,  "everywhere"), to give the sense of something that **sparkles** on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(205): A diamond **sparkle** s as brightly as three suns.;2) [[astgtciv](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv)] 14-4-2007(45): **Sparkle** is a [forest](../v4/197.html) (#197 森) of _suns_!;3) [[skrapmail](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skrapmail)] 10-9-2006(27): **Sparkle** , three suns sparkling like zelda pyramids ,-).;4) [[ruschein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein)] 4-1-2009(20): Nothing **sparkle** s like _3 suns_!;5) [[liosama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama)] 13-1-2010(12): Wow - Has been ages since I got this character up in a review, I failed it because I thought of a different kanji. Anyway this Kanji has a lot to do with crystals and crystal structure 液晶 liquid crystal, 結晶 crystal, crystallization, crystallisation, 結晶学 crystallography. So the connotation of 'diamond' is really good - maintain that and it will easily let you fall back to its main usage of crystals.
品;goods;As in the character for _sparkle_ , the triplication of a single element in this character indicates "everywhere" or "heaps of." When we think of **goods** in modern industrial society, we think of what has been mass- produced - that is to say, produced for the  "masses" of open _mouths_ waiting like fledglings in a nest to  "consume" whatever comes their way.;;1) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(93): _Three boxes_ of **goods** are devoured by the hungry _mouths_ of waiting consumers.;2) [[graham6565](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/graham6565)] 16-5-2007(68): Three hungry mouths waiting for the **goods** to come.;3) [[mazel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel)] 16-4-2008(44): Boxes of **goods** stacked on top of the other.;4) [[FuDaWei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FuDaWei)] 20-8-2009(7): Three stacked crates of _mouth_ -watering **GOODS** , ready for delivery to the restaurant.;5) [[pjdekl](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pjdekl)] 27-1-2010(6): Three MOUTHs talk about these _three boxes_ of **GOODS** : the producer’s, the supplier’s and the customer’s.
呂;spine;This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the **spine** linked by a single stroke.;;1) [[Thaliel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thaliel)] 8-7-2006(145): **Spine** connects head and body.;2) [[Senshi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Senshi)] 20-7-2007(54): The **spine** goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (genitals). Just think of these openings being enlarged to represent the head and the body. The bottom is bigger because the body is bigger than the face.;3) [[MichaelAnd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MichaelAnd)] 10-3-2008(37): The **spine** goes from one opening mouth/opening (mouth/face) to another mouth/opening (in your ass).;4) [[aoerstroem](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aoerstroem)] 21-10-2007(22): I looks like two vertebrae connected by nerve threads.;5) [[terozen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen)] 25-3-2012(10): In "The Human Centipede", one **spine** connects two mouths to keep the food circulating.
昌;prosperous;What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning "everywhere" or "heaps of" was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see _two suns_ , one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the _three suns_ of _sparkle_. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of **prosperous** times as _sunny_ , what could be more **prosperous** than a sky with _two suns_ in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there.;;1) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 25-9-2006(469): If you work from Sun UP to Sun DOWN you will be **prosperous**.;2) [[cutiehuni](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cutiehuni)] 14-2-2009(76): I kept getting this mixed up with meanings like 'fortune', so here is a fool proof story! Remember the Vulcan salute from 'Star Trek' (a fiction of the sci-fi genre in which heavenly bodies such as SUNS play a huge role) used with the phrase 'live long and PROSPER'? If that's not enough of a visual reminder, the Vulcan salute shows the fingers parted in to 2 sets of 2, and visually kind of looks like this kanji if you think about it.;3) [[ladymcBeth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ladymcBeth)] 27-8-2007(38): When you are **prosperous** , your gold shines as brightly as two suns.;4) [[Zantonio69](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zantonio69)] 4-2-2008(22): The Egyptians were **prosperous** because every two days, they worshiped the sun god at the sun pyramid. (Thanks for the idea adhmm, for a while I have had trouble remembering which sun is biggest. Got it now!).;5) [[ruschein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein)] 4-1-2009(19): If you work from _sun up_ to _sun down_ you will be **prosperous**.
早;early;This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the _sun_ flower, since it begins with the element for _sun_ and is held upon a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine _sun_ flowers with _needles_ for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks. The sense of **early** is easily remembered if one thinks of the _sun_ flower as the **early** riser in the garden, because the _sun_ , showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see frame 10).;* As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of _sunflower_ , which was used to make the abstract key word _early_ more graphic.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(290): The _sun_ up is **early** , well before _ten_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(34): An **early** sun-flower looks like a miniature sun perched on a needlelike stems.;3) [[Biserka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biserka)] 24-1-2009(32): **EARLY** , is when you have to start your _day_ before _10_..;4) [[Katerine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katerine)] 7-5-2009(16): The _sun_ rises **early** \- before _ten_.;5) [[bshug](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bshug)] 28-9-2009(7): Sun flower blossom **early**.
旭;rising sun;This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the **rising sun**. If you can picture two seams running down that great red _sun_ , and then imagine it sitting on a _baseball_ bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent - but not altogether inaccurate - picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the **Rising Sun**.;;1) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 11-11-2007(249): 9am carries with it the **rising sun**.;2) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(137): _Nine planets_ revolve around our **rising sun**.;3) [[xsahjax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xsahjax)] 8-8-2007(60): The sun rises before 9am.;4) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 30-3-2008(35): When the clock says _9_ on the left, you can see the **rising _sun_** in the east (right).;5) [[jefrsilva](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jefrsilva)] 30-3-2008(21): A baseball player hits the sun and it becomes the **rising sun**.
世;generation;We generally consider one **generation** as a period of thirty (or _ten_ plus _ten_ plus _ten_ ) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form - not in its stroke order - you will see three _tens_. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as  "addition" lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: _ten_ "plus" _ten_ "plus" _ten_ = thirty. Actually, it's a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(112): 3 tens = **generation**.;2) [[CarlKenner](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner)] 5-7-2007(71): They **SAY** a **generation** is _ten_ + _ten_ + _ten_ years, with the big first _ten_ providing a _grounding_ , and the next _ten_ providing a little more _grounding_ for the final _ten_. But I wish the next **generation** didn't always **SAY** " **yo!** ". (ON reading is SEI, KUN reading is yo).;3) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 30-6-2007(41): The next **generation** is carried by the previous ones.;4) [[csmdad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/csmdad)] 9-6-2008(40): That swing has been in that tree for **generation** s.;5) [[KeroHazel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KeroHazel)] 21-8-2008(25): This looks like a picture of a test tube in a holder. Maybe it will be used to create test tube babies for a future **generation**.
胃;stomach;You will need to refer back to frames 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: _flesh_ ( _part of the body_ ) and _brain_. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the _part of the body_ that keeps the _brain_ in working order is the **stomach**. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the _brain_ as being  "held up" by the _flesh_.;;1) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 27-8-2007(321): The _rice field_ is harvested once a _month_ to get food for our **stomach**.;2) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 21-7-2006(41): The **stomach** is the part of the body that digests food (which, in Japan, is mainly rice).;3) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 16-6-2008(35): The **stomach** is the part of the body ( 月 ）that tells my brain ( 田 ) when to eat rice.;4) [[gringozolano](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gringozolano)] 9-4-2008(30): The astronaut had an empty _stomach_ because you can't grow **rice** _on the_ **moon**.;5) [[hazyjazy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hazyjazy)] 19-8-2008(27): A field of rice could fill my **stomach** for over a month.
旦;nightbreak;While we normally refer to the start of the day as "daybreak," Japanese commonly refers to it as the "opening up of night" into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, **nightbreak**. The single stroke at the bottom represents the _floor_ (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the _sun_ is poking its head;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(191): A **nightbreak** happens when the sun rises over the horizon (floor).;2) [[tomb771](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomb771)] 9-2-2007(65): It may be easier to think of the keyword "DAYBREAK" or "MORNING" for this kanji (other kanji dictionaries do). Then the mnemonic phrase "SUN rising over the HORIZON" works better. It is an infrequent kanji, but can be found in: 旦夕 （たんせき） morning and evening, or 元旦 （がんたん） New Year's Day.;3) [[Cacawate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cacawate)] 7-12-2006(43): The _sun_ rising over the horizon is giving the **night** a **break**. - **nightbreak**.;4) [[epsilondelta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta)] 15-12-2009(23): HINT: You can substitute **sunrise** in your stories if you don't like the rare (and ambiguous) "nightbreak". Note that [daybreak](../v4/1201.html) (#1201 暁) is already taken. Don't confuse with [rising sun](../v4/27.html) (#27 旭), which is the sun itself, rather than the time of the day.;5) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(13): **Nightbreak** s when the _sun_ peeks over the _horizon_ at dawn.
胆;gall bladder;The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for _part of the body_ , and on the right, the character for _nightbreak_ , which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the **gall bladder** is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the **gall bladder** is supposed to filter out), and change it to  "not letting the _night break_ on your anger " (or your **gall** ) - and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed by letting the sun set on it and then "sleeping it off.";;1) [[smiro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smiro)] 11-11-2007(279): The moon has a lot of gall sticking around after sunrise.;2) [[arturo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arturo)] 20-7-2007(124): All the _month_ long I have to start working at _nightbreak_. This really activates my **gall bladder** (=I get angry).;3) [[randomassortmentofletters](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/randomassortmentofletters)] 31-5-2009(88): For a month（ 月 ）, I was up until nightbreak（ 旦 ） because of my **gall bladder** （ 胆 ）.;4) [[yaban](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yaban)] 15-1-2007(49): The **gall bladder** digests the flesh (meat) before nightbreak so you are ready to start your new day.;5) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 14-1-2008(26): If you drink all night long (moon), until the night break your **gall bladder** will have problems…
亘;span;"Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset..." goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the _floor_ ) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead ( _ceiling_ ) and then disappears over the other horizon - day after day, marking the **span** of our lives.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(227): The sun **span** s from horizon to horizon in a day.;2) [[nihonnicko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nihonnicko)] 1-5-2008(45): The **span** of the day is the time between the sun goes up and comes down.;3) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 2-2-2008(17): The sunlight **span** s from the floor to the ceiling.;4) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 30-6-2007(9): The sun **span** s the heaven and the earth.;5) [[kanpai](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanpai)] 27-1-2011(8): A sun **span** -wich.
凹;concave;You couldn't have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a **concave** lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little  "cave." Now all you have to do is learn how to write it.;;1) [[hella](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hella)] 4-3-2007(105): The letter "U" is **concave** ly written.;2) [[xiteru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru)] 9-10-2007(44): **Concave** has a **concave** shape.;3) [[geekdiva](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/geekdiva)] 30-11-2005(22): Stroke order: I took a step down into the cave. A park ranger threw down a line to me from the opposite top ridge, then waited. My friend went down to the lowest passage to look for me, then the ranger threw another line down to her.;4) [[oohansel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oohansel)] 21-7-2009(11): **Concave** is like a vagina.;5) [[electrohaze](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/electrohaze)] 16-4-2012(8): Her **CONCAVE** 凹 pussy was fucked by my convex 凸 cock.
凸;convex;Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no trouble keeping **convex** distinct from _concave_. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn't feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it.;;1) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 30-6-2007(108): When I get _vex_ ed, I give people the middle finger.;2) [[xiteru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru)] 9-10-2007(63): **Convex** has a **convex** shape.;3) [[wholefnfro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wholefnfro)] 1-4-2008(33): Sex makes me **convex**.;4) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 11-11-2008(18): Men are **convex** , women are complex.;5) [[akaiYaMa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akaiYaMa)] 12-1-2009(11): Japanese Idol's make my pants **convex**.
旧;olden times;A _walking stick_ is needed for _days_ of **olden times** , since _days_ , too, get old - at least insofar as we refer to them as the "good old days." The main thing here is to think of "good old days" when you hear the key word **olden times**. The rest will take care of itself.;;1) [[gangsterdesunee](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gangsterdesunee)] 17-8-2007(225): Age 18 = **olden times**.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(86): The old man with a walking stick kept talking of **olden times** all day long.;3) [[ctalbottclark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctalbottclark)] 20-2-2008(51): In **olden times** , gentlemen used _walking sticks_ every _day_.;4) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 29-10-2007(26): In the **olden times** the sun used a walking stick, cursing and swinging at planets as they whizzed by.;5) [[danroddy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/danroddy)] 27-10-2007(14): The number 18 on an **olden times** calculator.
自;oneself;You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little _drop_ that Mother Nature set between your _eyes_. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose - giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for **oneself**.;* The same meaning of _oneself_ can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive element, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of _nose_ or _nostrils_ , both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for _nose_ (Frame 733).;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(140): To use an eyedropper by **oneself** , aim from _above_ to put a _drop_ into the _eye_.;2) [[pikako](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pikako)] 14-11-2007(89): Faced with his clone, our hero valiantly cut a _mark_ on his forehead right above his _eye_ so that his comrades could tell his true **oneself** from the enemy.;3) [[indigo360](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo360)] 22-7-2008(77): I know this, but I am an idiot and forgot…. The way I remember this is to think of the way in which Japanese people point to themselves if they are unsure of who is being spoken to. In the west, we usually say, "me?" and point to ourselves (pointing to the chest), but in Japan, people say, "ore/boku/atashi?" and point directly at their nose, the drop between their eyes. True story.;4) [[wraxus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wraxus)] 16-8-2008(40): Eyedrops are applied by **ONESELF**.;5) [[kiisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kiisu)] 22-1-2008(26): Me, myself and eye.
白;white;The color **white** is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the sun. Hence, a single _drop_ of _sun_ spells **white**.;* As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of _white_ or take the more graphic meaning of a _white bird_ or _dove_. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for _bird_ , which we shall get to later (Frame 2091).;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(130): A **white** ray is a drop of sun.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 29-10-2007(61): Even a small drop (') of the sun ( 日 ) would make you see nothing but **white**.;3) [[hazelsmrf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hazelsmrf)] 5-5-2008(25): It's a nice DAY for a **WHITE** wedding.;4) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 31-10-2008(14): **WHITE** is a drop of sun.;5) [[lugelen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lugelen)] 1-9-2011(11): A _drop_ one _day_ fell from above, it was **white** and from a _dove_ … gross.
百;hundred;The Japanese refer to a person's 99th birthday as a " _white_ year " because _white_ is the kanji you are left with if you subtract _one_ from a **hundred**.;;1) [[noushina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noushina)] 30-12-2006(152): 100 turned sideways. sort of the same as what ashoksaraf said.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-9-2007(89): That dirty ceiling was painted WHITE a **hundred** times!;3) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 5-7-2006(36): **Hundred** is 1 0 0 written from top to bottom. 一 is connected with the two concatenated 口 because the latter would otherwise fall off.;4) [[Chauser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chauser)] 5-11-2008(35): The "white year" (99) plus one more. 100!;5) [[ashoksaraf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashoksaraf)] 12-12-2006(19): Two O hung on one.
中;in;The elements here are a _walking stick_ and a _mouth_. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine **in** your _mouth_? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather's _walking stick_ , to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something **in** from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil **in** to a baby's mouth.;;1) [[Rose_Arteth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rose_Arteth)] 17-8-2007(143): Pocky goes **in** the mouth.;2) [[samesong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong)] 22-3-2009(116): My GF lets me come **in** her mouth (pictogram).;3) [[blahdi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blahdi)] 7-9-2009(35): It's my dick **in** a box!;4) [[mairov](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mairov)] 8-7-2007(21): I use chopsticks to put food **in** my mouth.;5) [[narazumono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono)] 27-8-2008(12): **In** diana Jones thrust a _walking stick_ **in** the crocadile's _mouth_ just **in** time!
千;thousand;This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the _drop_ above and the _ten_ below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an _eyedropper_ alongside the number _ten_ to make it a **thousand**.;;1) [[Branduil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil)] 26-2-2006(136): It takes many drops of ten to get to a **thousand**.;2) [[toddiceton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/toddiceton)] 4-11-2008(108): _One_ T = one **thousand**.;3) [[dat5h](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h)] 15-7-2008(39): **1000** = _10_ ^3 ( _3 strokes_ ).;4) [[DanielC](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DanielC)] 13-7-2008(34): The primitives of _drop_ and _needles_ are at work here. One drop from this needle could save **thousands** of lives!;5) [[Robatsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Robatsu)] 11-1-2009(26): The number ten bought a fancy hat for a **THOUSAND** yen!
舌;tongue;The primitive for _mouth_ and the character for _thousand_ naturally form the idea of **tongue** if one thinks of a _thousand mouths_ able to speak the same language, or as we say,  "sharing a common **tongue**. " It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single **tongue** being passed around from _mouth_ to _mouth_.;;1) [[wzafran](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran)] 16-5-2007(199): What is in a _mouth_ that permits it to speak a _thousand_ things? Yes, a **tongue**.;2) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 16-11-2008(82): A _thousand mouths_ speak the same **TONGUE**.;3) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 1-7-2007(48): Kissing a _thousand_ _mouths_ eventually gets you some **tongue**.;4) [[PeterNowak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterNowak)] 6-1-2008(39): Thousand mouths, a thousand **tongue** s.;5) [[jonnay](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonnay)] 13-2-2007(16): When you _drop_ because you are [old](../v4/16.html) (#16 古), you stick your **tongue** out.
升;measuring box;This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a _thousand_ sharp _needles_ , and the quaint little **measuring box** becomes a drinker's nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of _thousand_. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last.;;1) [[solarmist](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/solarmist)] 26-6-2008(393): It is a thousand or ten? I need my **measuring box**.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-7-2007(120): I can fit a thousand needles into my **measuring box** , but only if I bend the thousand.;3) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 11-7-2006(75): A **measuring box** is a square wooden box that was used to measure one thousand grains of rice (needles) in feudal Japan. It was supposed to be enough to feed a working man for one day.;4) [[panikbuton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton)] 20-1-2008(31): Be careful when drinking sake out of a deep **measuring box**. The hangover can feel like a thousand needles.;5) [[Wosret](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret)] 25-4-2008(23): Give me a thousand smacks with a walking stick if I forget the Kanji for **measuring box** again!
昇;rise up;Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a _sun_ and a _measuring box_. Just as the _sun_ can be seen **rising up** in the morning from - where else - the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the _sun_ **rising up** out of a Japanese _measuring box_  \- the " _measuring box_ of the **rising-up** _sun_. ";;1) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 23-2-2008(387): This kanji does not mean "get up" or "awake." It means rising, like the rising of a salary, or a promotion. STORY: You know that your salary has RISEN UP when your MEASURING BOX has enough dollar bills in it to reach the SUN.;2) [[vipigz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vipigz)] 3-12-2007(119): We Measure the Sun to decide when we should **Rise Up** out of bed.;3) [[pikako](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pikako)] 2-2-2007(77): If the _sun_ sat on the _measuring box_ made of a thousand needles he would **rise up** very quickly.;4) [[Pangolin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin)] 24-7-2006(63): In old Japan the villagers used to put their measuring box on an east facing window ledge so that the sun would **rise up** above it and hence would be the first thing they saw in the morning. This was to remind them to use the box to measure out their kome for asagohan and ensure their store of rice would last the whole week.;5) [[wraxus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wraxus)] 30-10-2008(50): "When sun **RISE UP** , get sake cup.".
丸;round;We speak of " **round** numbers, " or " **rounding** a number off, " meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest _drop_ , to _nine_ , you end up with a **round** number.;* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a _fat man_. Think of a grotesquely _fat man_ whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a _round baseball player_ becomes a _fat man_.;1) [[akimoto](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto)] 20-6-2006(235): Nine plus a drop **round** s it off to ten!;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 16-8-2007(97): Watch out for [plump](../v4/120.html) (#120 太). Here Heisig could have added a "t" and we would have had a much better keyword : **rotund**. **Rotund** is more specific than "round" which begs for confusion with [circle](../v4/1811.html) (#1811 円). A dictionary search on "fat" or "round" doesn't yield this kanji, but "rotund" does! Primitive suggestion: the _Laughing Buddha_ is often depicted as a **rotund** , smiling bald man in robes with a largely exposed pot belly stomach (symbolizing plenitude).;3) [[aspr8045](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aspr8045)] 30-1-2009(17): NINE plus a little DROP to **round** up to ten.;4) [[blueberry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blueberry)] 3-2-2010(15): Cut the tail off of a 9 and it will be **round**.;5) [[KumaRob](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KumaRob)] 2-8-2012(11): In nine months a drop of sperm can make a woman very **round**.
寸;measurement;This kanji actually stood for a small **measurement** used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of **measurement**. In the old system, it was one- _tenth_ of a _shaku_ (whose kanji we shall meet in frame 1151). The picture, appropriately, represents one _drop_ of a _ten_  (with a hook!).;* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean _glue_ or _glued to_. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard NOT to remember it.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 26-8-2007(330): The decimal system uses _drops_ of _ten_ as a **measurement**.;2) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 19-10-2007(73): Glue two sticks together to make the best **measurement**. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.).;3) [[leebo_mac](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/leebo_mac)] 1-3-2009(64): Use two lines (X axis and Y axis) to measure the dot (on the graph).;4) [[w_oertl](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/w_oertl)] 23-9-2007(36): Take your medicine, exactly _ten_ _drops_. Picture yourself **measuring** it out with a pipette.;5) [[ale87](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ale87)] 18-3-2008(31): A single shaku is divided into 10 sun ( 寸 ). The original definition for shaku was the average distance between growth nodes on a bamboo. Thus a _tenth_ of a shaku is a **measurement**.
肘;elbow;Instead of the familiar "grease" we usually associate with the **elbow** of someone hard at work, the kanji gives us a _part of the body_ that has been _glued to_ its task.;;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 10-6-2007(60): Sometimes I get carried away and do **elbow** curls until the point where my forearm snaps off! When that happens I simply pull out the _glue_ and re-attach the **elbow** to my _flesh_.;2) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 14-11-2008(22): Picture two Siamese twins glued together at the **elbow**.;3) [[aaroncp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp)] 2-2-2011(19): The **elbow** is the _flesh_ that _glues_ together the upper and lower arm.;4) [[lernsky](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lernsky)] 10-1-2013(8): A _body part_ that's used as a _measurement_ in former days: the **elbow**.;5) [[gavmck](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck)] 3-3-2010(8): A _body part_ used in the expression " **Elbow** room" as a _measure_ of how much space exists around us.
専;specialty;_Ten_ . . . _rice fields_ . . . _glue_. That is how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these elements, we get:  " _Ten rice fields glued_ together. " A **specialty** , of course, refers to one's special " _field_ " of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single **specialty** and usually extend themselves in other _fields_ as well. This is how we come to get the picture of _ten fields glued_ together to represent a **specialty**.;;1) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 17-11-2007(287): After you have chosen your _10_ _fields_ of study, _measure_ how good you are at each to find out your **specialty**.;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 7-7-2007(97): 10 brains glued together allows you to specialize in any **specialty** that you want. Imagine each brain having its own **specialty**.;3) [[EnohIO](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EnohIO)] 26-2-2009(43): She's so good at her **speciality** , it's like _ten_ _brains_ _glue_ d together.;4) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 12-4-2008(26): I'm a Rice Field Measurer! That is, my **specialty** is 'measuring' 'ten' 'rice fields' at a time.;5) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(24): A person's **specialty** or _field_ , may change _up_ to _ten_ times before they finally settle _down_ and _stick_ with their liking.
博;Dr.;At the left we have the _needle_ , at the right, the kanji for _specialty_ , plus an extra _drop_ at the top. Think of a **Dr.** who is a _specialist_ with a _needle_ (an acupuncturist) and let the _drop_ at the top represent the period at the end of **Dr.** In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions, but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.;* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the _needle_ on the left and gets the meaning of an _acupuncturist_.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-9-2007(307): _Ten specialties_ grants you the title of **Dr.** with a dot.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 29-7-2006(109): Watch for [doctor](../v4/1694.html) (#1694 医), the sooner the better! In fact this kanji refers to someone well "learned", with extensive knowledge. This could apply to any kind of field. The kanji 医 ("doctor") is directly related to medicine. I would suggest to take away completely the idea of medicine here, and use a popular character whose name includes the keyword such as "Dr. Who", "Dr. Jekyll", even "Dr. Dobb's" if you're into programming.;3) [[DanielC](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DanielC)] 13-7-2008(37): _Needles_ are a **Dr.** 's _specialty_.;4) [[anthropic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic)] 7-7-2008(31): **Dr**. Who weaves like a _needle_ through the fabric of time, to _drop_ in unexpectedly has become his [specialty](../v4/46.html) (#46 専) .;5) [[cangy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy)] 22-4-2010(17): Note: Use **Ph.D.** rather than **Dr.** to avoid confusion with **doctor** and to be more in line with common use of this kanji. _Ten_ _specialities_ grants you the title of **Ph.D.** with a _dot_.
占;fortune-telling;This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a _divining rod_ with a _mouth_  \- which translate directly into **fortune-telling**. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first _divining rod_ , then _mouth_. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(147): **Fortune-telling** : using a mouth as a divining rod.;2) [[Hikari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hikari)] 27-8-2007(95): A great number of people who do **fortune-telling** are "almost old".;3) [[sprutnik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik)] 28-9-2008(37): To do **fortune-telling** put a _magic wand_ in your _mouth_.;4) [[pandaji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pandaji)] 10-10-2007(17): The mouth of a fortune-teller is a superior (above) mouth.;5) [[nihonnicko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nihonnicko)] 1-5-2008(13): The old fortune teller was missing an arm.
上;above;The two directions, **above** and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a _magic wand_ standing **_above_** a _floor_  \- "magically," you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words **above** and _below_ suggest each other.;;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(58): A _magic wand_ standing on **above** the floor.;2) [[ruschein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruschein)] 4-1-2009(18): The _divining rod_ is **above** the _floor_.;3) [[jeevanjee](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jeevanjee)] 18-1-2008(13): Water Faucet is **ABOVE** the Ground.;4) [[spike287](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spike287)] 20-7-2010(7): Whoa, that _magic wand_ is **above** the _floor_ by itself!;5) [[Tsuki56](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki56)] 6-6-2009(7): I hold my hand **above** my broom as I cry "UP!".
下;below;Here we see our famous miraculous _magic wand_ hanging, all on its own, **below** the _ceiling_ , as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for _ceiling_ and _floor_ , by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and **below** the primitive element to which it is related.;;1) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 30-6-2007(77): Roots are **below** the ground.;2) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 2-7-2007(48): A _magic wand_ hanging **below** the ceiling.;3) [[indiana23](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indiana23)] 24-12-2009(6): Peeing off a cliff "Watch out **BELOW**!".;4) [[romethebeast](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romethebeast)] 6-12-2009(5): A T with it's wang **below**.;5) [[brianandyoko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brianandyoko)] 13-11-2008(4): This time the DIVINING ROD has been pushed **below** the ceiling deforming its handle.
卓;eminent;The word **eminent** suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a _magic wand_ and a _sunflower_  \- is to think of the world's most **eminent** magician as one who uses a _sunflower_ for a _magic wand_ (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love).;;1) [[thatkidpercy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy)] 16-11-2007(338): The most **eminent** magician is he who learned to use his _magic wand early_ in life.;2) [[canji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji)] 26-7-2008(38): The world's most **eminent** sourcerer, Harry Potter, used his _magic wand early_ in life.;3) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 6-7-2006(38): The **eminent** sunflower is the one that stands above the others.;4) [[GrimPanda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GrimPanda)] 21-9-2010(25): When a car ( 車 ) [car](../v4/286.html) (#286 車) loses a wheel, disaster is **eminent**.;5) [[kfactor](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kfactor)] 5-7-2007(23): The world's most **eminent** fortune-teller is also the earliest of all. He produces his predictions amazingly fast.
朝;morning;On the right we see the _moon_ fading off into the first light of **morning** , and to the left, the _mist_ that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the _moon_ tilting over to spill _mist_ on your garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character.;;1) [[Rinifett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rinifett)] 25-9-2007(186): There is mist as the moon fades away in the **morning**.;2) [[Yasser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser)] 19-10-2008(96): **Morning** has come "ten" hours "early"!!! The "moon" is still in the sky!;3) [[Sanachan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sanachan)] 9-1-2008(48): In the **morning** , god picks the _sun_ up to the sky with two _needles_ (because it's too hot to touch by hands) to replace the _moon_.;4) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(31): The **morning** _mist_ is the _moon_ 's parting tears–sprinkling _ten early flowers_ with dew when she leaves the sky each day.;5) [[sprutnik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik)] 28-9-2008(25): In the **morning** the _mist_ and _moon_ fades away.
嘲;derision;The bad feeling created by words spoken in **derision** often leaves a bad taste in the _mouth_ of the one who speaks them, kind of like the foul aftertaste that follows a night before of too much of the wrong stuff - or what we call _morning mouth_.;;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 23-4-2007(72): When I wake up, I am always late, so I hurry to work. With a bad case of perpetual morning breath, I am the subject of **derision** at my office whenever I open my mouth.;2) [[Aerin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin)] 12-8-2008(39): If _morning_ breath emanates from your _mouth_ , you are subject to **derision**!;3) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 13-6-2007(11): Truly the epic mother-in-law who, at the very crack of _morning_ , already possesses a _mouth_ full of **derision**.;4) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 10-12-2006(9): Your _mouth_ is full of **derision** in the _morning_ because you're grumpy.;5) [[tuuli](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tuuli)] 13-11-2008(5): When I opened my _mouth_ to suggest an early _morning_ meeting, my suggestion was met with **derision**.
只;only;When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression "it's the **only** one of its kind. " Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-manlike creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic _mouth_ and two wee _animal legs_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-8-2007(231): Imagine an animal with **only** a _mouth_ and _leg_ s.;2) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 3-5-2008(118): My girlfriend insists that the _only_ thing I want from her is what's between her legs.. She's drawn me this pictograph to demonstrate. It's a _head_ and two legs spread apart.. I explain that I also love her breasts, and then she smacks me in the face. I'll never understand women.. (I keep failing this kanji, hopefully this silly story will help me!).;3) [[hazyjazy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hazyjazy)] 2-9-2008(49): **Only** your mouth runs faster than your legs.;4) [[Neobeo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo)] 27-11-2008(28): Men **only** want that mouth between the legs.;5) [[CarlKenner](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner)] 5-7-2007(28): **Tada**!… **SHE** is the **only** animal with **only** a _mouth_ on _legs_ and no body! (Kun reading tada, ON reading SHI).
貝;shellfish;To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an _eye_ and _animal legs_ , you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a **shellfish** with its ridged shell at the top and two little _legs_ sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish **shellfish** with a single, gigantic _eye_ roaming the beaches on its slender little _legs_ , scaring the wits out of the sunbathers.;* When used as a primitive, in addition to _shells_ , the meanings _oyster_ and _clam_ will often come in handy.;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 16-1-2008(52): _Eye_ thought I saw a **shellfish** _legging_ it down the beach!;2) [[eugs51](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eugs51)] 17-10-2007(36): Stare at the **shellfish** , it looks like an eye with legs.;3) [[Teango](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango)] 6-3-2010(23): Remove the _eyes_ and the _legs_ , and a **shellfish** tastes great!;4) [[CarlKenner](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner)] 5-7-2007(14): The **guy** couldn't **BUY** any **shellfish** which had one giant _eye_ and walked on _animal legs_ , so he went out in his **kay** ak to catch some. (Kun readings are kai or gai, ON reading is BAI).;5) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 21-11-2008(10): **SHELLFISH** look like big _eyes_ with _legs_.
唄;pop song;There is a lot of money to be made of one's **songs** are  " **pop** ular." This is depicted here as a stream of _clams_ spewing out of the _mouth_ of someone performing a **pop song**.;;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 7-5-2007(82): The new generation of **pop songs** have no depth. They just _mouth_ empty lyrics to get _money_. Not like the **pop songs** of my day.;2) [[Machine_Gun_Cat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Machine_Gun_Cat)] 10-7-2009(17): A new way for sluts to use their mouths to make alot of money.;3) [[Boy.pockets](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Boy.pockets)] 15-1-2011(16): Out of the _mouth_ comes a **pop song** and in rolls the _money_.;4) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 15-12-2006(10): Critics of popular music often complain that pop music doesn't require technique. They say that any idiot who opens his _mouth_ and sings a **pop song** will make _money_.;5) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 13-4-2007(5): Think Milli Vanilli - Guys _mouthing_ **pop song** s just to make _money_.
貞;upright;Now take the last primitive, the _shellfish_ , and set a _magic wand_ over it, and you have the kanji for **upright**. After all, the _clam_ and the _oyster_ are incapable of walking **upright**. It would take a magician with his _wand_ to pull off such a feat - which is precisely what we have in this kanji.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 21-8-2007(169): A _magic wand_ is needed to make a _clam_ stand **upright**.;2) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 2-5-2008(121): Just the thought of my _magic wand_ on her _clam_ makes my _magic wand_ stand **upright**.;3) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 16-12-2007(61): 貞 【てい】 (n) (1) firm adherence to one's principles, (2) chastity (of a woman) what this has to do with "upright"… not sure. but heres a story for CHASTITY: "a magician uses his MAGIC WAND to shut the crotch of a maiden as tight as a CLAM, to protect her CHASTITY".;4) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 16-1-2008(28): To get the _shellfish_ to stand **upright** , just poke it with a _magic wand_!;5) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 12-1-2009(17): An **UPRIGHT** person is _above_ ( 上 ) petty disputes, and always holds their head _up_ ( 上 ).

員;employee;How do we get a _mouth_ over a _shellfish_ to mean an **employee**? Simple. Just remember the advice new **employees** get about keeping their _mouths_ shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by picturing an office building full of white collar workers scurrying around with _clams_ pinched to their _mouths_.;;1) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 12-4-2008(119): An **employee** ( **member** of the company) has to clam up his mouth if he wants keep the job!;2) [[seshiiru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seshiiru)] 13-12-2007(57): An **employee** is basically a shellfish with a mouth.;3) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 12-1-2009(34): An **employee** is a worker.

貼;post a bill;The key word in this frame has do with **posting bills** to a billboard. In this case, the billboard is standing at the exit to a Chinese restaurant displaying the latest alternative to the tradition _fortune-telling_ cookies. Look closely and you will see rows of leftover shells of _clams_ with little slips of paper sticking out of them **posted** to the billboard.;;1) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 12-11-2008(43): Fortune teller writes your fortune on a piece of paper and tells you to **affix** it to a shell and throw into the ocean for it to come true.

見;see;The elements that compose the character for **see** are the _eye_ firmly fixed to a pair of _human legs_. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character....;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 29-6-2007(146): As a primitive, this is Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc.

児;newborn babe;The top part of the kanji in this frame, you will remember, is the character for _olden times_ , those _days_ so old they needed a _walking stick_ to get around. Western mythical imagination has old  "Father Time" leaning on his sickle with a **newborn babe** crawling around his _legs_ , the idea being that the circle of birth and-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for _olden times_ will appear as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it.;;1) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 30-6-2007(301): In the _olden times_ , a **newborn babe** came out _leg_ s first.;2) [[EasyG](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/EasyG)] 30-8-2008(58): In the _olden times_ , a **newborn babe** came from between the _leg_ s.

元;beginning;"In the **beginning**... " starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made _two_ of them, man and woman. While we presume she made _two_ of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only   _two_ and a pair of _human legs_ come to the kanji that means **beginning**.;;1) [[mukade](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mukade)] 10-7-2007(236): In the **beginning** were just _two_ who walked on _human legs_.;2) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(71): In the **beginning** God created woman, and God asked her how she liked his work.

God nodded, and the middle breast fell off… and it was good. Woman picked up the breast and said, "Thank you, God! But what do I do with this useless boob?" And God created man. That's why the women today only have _two_ boobs to match their _two human legs_.;3) [[smiro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smiro)] 18-11-2007(46): Every journey begins with your two legs.;4) [[Tatiana](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tatiana)] 10-10-2006(14): Grandpa Woody always began stories from his youth with "In the **beginning** , when I had _two_ _legs_ …".;5) [[domokun1134](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/domokun1134)] 24-11-2009(8): In the **beginning** we start out with nothing but our own two legs.
頁;page;What we have to do here is turn a _shellfish_ into a **page** of a book. The _one_ at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact only _one_ **page**. Imagine a title printed on the shell of an _oyster_ , let us say "Pearl of Wisdom," and then open the quaint book to its _one_ and only **page** , on which you find a single, radiant _drop of_ wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature.;* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a _head_ (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for _head_ (Frame 1549).;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 8-10-2007(237): A _shellfish_ carrying a **page** balanced on its _head_.;2) [[narazumono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narazumono)] 27-8-2008(103): _One_ _drop_ of ink from a _shellfish_ can fill a whole **page**.;3) [[thatkidpercy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy)] 16-11-2007(58): A _shellfish_ dangles from the _ceiling_ Mission-Impossible style, desperate to recover the **page** of revealing images that were taken from him.;4) [[kapalama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama)] 9-10-2011(29): 頁岩 , 頁 , [page](../v4/60.html) (#60 頁) ケツ, ページ … Parts: 一 , 丶, 自 , ハor 一 , 丶, 貝 (cf: 順番 , お願い , 頭 , 頂く , etc.) … Tip: This is a never used Kanji, but you are going to see it a few hundred more times in RTK as a primitive. Here's something that I figured out way too late. This is _ALWAYS_ _ALWAYS_ on the right hand side (RHS) of the characters it is a part of. _Always_.. Learn this primitive cold, and remember, always on the RHS.;5) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 29-10-2007(29): _One_ **page** may not seem like much, but if it contains _drop_ of wisdom, it is worth the _clams_ you _shell_ ed out for it.
頑;stubborn;This character refers to the block _headed_ , persistent **stubbornness** of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the _beginning_ , without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation makes "sense," but is hard to remember because the word " _beginning_ "is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all **stubbornness** goes back to the _beginning_ , with two brothers each **stubbornly** defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled _heads_ , each vying for the favors of heaven, a **stubborn** grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened!;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 26-8-2007(273): A **stubborn** person in the _beginning_ gets something into their _head_ and can't change their mind.;2) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 16-11-2007(186): Picture a **STUBBORN** schoolboy, with his arms crossed and his book still open to the BEGINNING PAGE.

凡;mediocre;While we refer to something insignificant as a " _drop_ in the bucket, " the kanji for **mediocre** suggests the image of a  " _drop_ in the _wind_. ";;1) [[panikbuton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton)] 20-1-2008(132): Is there anything as **mediocre** as a drop of piss in the wind?;2) [[mukade](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mukade)] 10-7-2007(98): A _drop_ of breeze is naught but a **mediocre** _wind_.;3) [[talloberon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/talloberon)] 20-4-2008(47): A drop of rain in the wind… what a **mediocre** rainy season…;4) [[xiteru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru)] 9-10-2007(27): **Mediocre** people hide under the table.;5) [[ChrisSimons](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ChrisSimons)] 18-4-2006(14): All we are is Dust in the Wind- a great example of a **mediocre** song.
負;defeat;Above we have the condensed form of _bound up_ , and below the familiar _shellfish_. Now imagine two _oysters_ engaged in _shell_ -to- _shell_ combat, the one who is **defeated** being _bound and gagged_ with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The _bound shellfish_ thus becomes the symbol for **defeat**.;;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 23-1-2008(219): _Tied up_ , the _shellfish_ had to accept **defeat**!;2) [[koldbein](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koldbein)] 17-2-2009(29): The _shellfish_ admitted **defeat** when they placed a _hook_ on top of his head.;3) [[shadolite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite)] 25-12-2007(17): **Defeat** is defined by a shellfish in binds.;4) [[cyberclops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cyberclops)] 14-1-2010(11): A _shellfish bound up_ in a fisherman's net has been **defeat** ed.;5) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 18-12-2007(9): If you are **DEFEAT** ED you are BOUND into slavery and the world will not be your OYSTER.
万;ten thousand;Japanese counts higher numbers in units of **ten thousand** , unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read "four **ten-thousands** " by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to _bind up_ a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for _one_ and _bound up_ naturally come to form **ten thousand**. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for _bound up_ in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together.;;1) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 30-10-2007(249): I _bound_ **ten thousand** dollars together and hid it under the _floor_.;2) [[Sleepyhead](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sleepyhead)] 30-1-2009(87): IT'S OVER 9000!!!!!!;3) [[Starkii](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Starkii)] 10-6-2008(58): It looks like a T and an H put together.;4) [[Narges](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Narges)] 13-11-2006(49): We have "one" at the top and if you turn the kanji 90 degrees you will see arabic 4 shich means it has four zeros in front of it!;5) [[Tatiana](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tatiana)] 18-10-2006(21): Think of Tao: **ten thousand** things are all _bound up_ into _one_.
句;phrase;By combining the two primitives _bound up_ and _mouth_ , we can easily see how this character can get the meaning of a **phrase**. After all, a **phrase** is nothing more than a number of words _bound up_ tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your _mouth_.;;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 31-10-2007(144): Some Japanese **phrase** s are difficult to _wrap_ your _mouth_ around.;2) [[shadolite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite)] 25-12-2007(118): A bound mouth cannot utter a single **phrase**.;3) [[atylmo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atylmo)] 1-4-2008(60): A **phrase** is a bunch of bound up words coming out of a mouth.;4) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 12-4-2008(13): I use my _mouth_ to _bind_ words together, thus forming a **phrase** or sentence ( 句 ).;5) [[mukade](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mukade)] 10-7-2007(7): _Bind_ your _mouth_ in case the wrong **phrase** gets out.
肌;texture;Ever notice how the **texture** of your face and hands is affected by the _wind_? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a _part of the body_ gets exposed to the _wind_ , its **texture** is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside **texture** connotes how something is  "to the touch.");;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 6-2-2007(245): When you expose your _flesh_ to the _wind_ it gets **textured** : goosebumps!;2) [[Rachael](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rachael)] 25-1-2008(136): The _moon_ 's lack of _wind_ preserves its **texture**.;3) [[Tsuki11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tsuki11)] 30-10-2007(36): Because the _moon_ has no _wind_ the **texture** of it's cratered surface never changes or erodes.;4) [[Loren](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Loren)] 17-8-2008(20): The Moon And The Wind Create The Sea's Wavey **Texture**!;5) [[Teango](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango)] 12-3-2010(7): A month of wind changes the **texture** of your skin.
旬;decameron;There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block often days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, **decameron** , whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of ten _days_ taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people _bound together_ for the _days_ of the **decameron**.;;1) [[yukkuri_kame](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame)] 6-4-2009(218): Hesig should be BOUND for a DAY (or maybe 10 days - a **decameron** ) for calling this Kanji **DECAMERON**. See [martyrdom](../v4/809.html) (#809 殉).;2) [[Pulse](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pulse)] 18-3-2012(165): **Hint:** _Here's info from Wikipedia regarding why this kanji exists, which helped me remember it:_ [Japan also divides the month roughly into three 10-day periods. Each is called a jun ( 旬 ). The first is jōjun ( 上旬 ), the second, chūjun ( 中旬 ), the last, gejun ( 下旬 ). These are frequently used to indicate approximate times, for example, "the temperatures are typical of the jōjun of April", "a vote on a bill is expected during the gejun of this month."].;3) [[blahdi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blahdi)] 8-9-2009(85): What the fuck?;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 22-7-2007(70): If you bind up ten days, you get a **decameron**.;5) [[panikbuton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton)] 20-1-2008(33): For producing Titanic, James **deCameron** should be bound for 10 days.
勺;ladle;If you want to _bind up drops_ of anything - water, soup, lemonade - you use something to scoop these _drops_ up, which is what we call a **ladle**. See the last _drop_ left inside the **ladle**?;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 22-7-2007(147): A **ladle** binds drops together.;2) [[bspeaks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bspeaks)] 21-3-2007(54): Forget about the primative 'bound up'. Imagine instead the shape of a **ladle** and holding it upside down to drink the last DROP (of water).;3) [[Robatsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Robatsu)] 15-1-2009(28): The last _drop_ stays _bound_ to the **LADLE**.;4) [[Bokeaji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bokeaji)] 10-10-2008(11): I'm bound and determined to get that last drop with this **ladle**!;5) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(7): A **ladle** holding a tiny fart.
的;bull´s eye;The elements _white bird_ and _ladle_ easily suggest the image of a **bull's eye** if you imagine a rusty old _ladle_ with a **bull's eye** painted on it in the form of a tiny _white bird_ , who lets out a little "peep" every time you hit the target.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 22-7-2007(223): I managed to hit the bull's eye by throwing my white ladle.;2) [[seanolan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/seanolan)] 10-10-2006(167): A _white_ , _bound up_ , _drop_ in the center is the bull's eye. (why Heisig had to use "ladle" instead of the original two primitives that make up "ladle" I'll never understand!).;3) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 21-7-2007(52): You're outside at a BBQ making the white sauce to go with whats on the grill. You lift the ladle to your lips. Right after you close your eyes to take a taste, a drop of white bird shit falls into the ladle - " Bull's Eye! " the bird says.

首;neck;Reading this kanji from the top down, we have: _horns_ . . . _nose_. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great _horns_ and long _nose_. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's  "head" to hang on the wall, the Japanese speak of cutting off its **neck**. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word **neck** conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g **neck** hanging over the fireplace, whose _horns_ you use for a coat-rack and whose _nose_ has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character. Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the element for _horns_ : that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here.;;1) [[bakamono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bakamono)] 20-8-2007(130): The V shape is your **neck** on top of your collar bone, or the straight line. _Yourself_ , or the rest of your body is below that!;2) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 24-8-2006(96): The mooses **neck** supports it's big horns and long nose.;3) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 30-9-2009(74): One has a strong **NECK** if one can carry HORNS on ONESELF.;4) [[Wosret](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret)] 25-4-2008(58): There are no goddamn animal legs in the Kanji for **neck**. Stop thinking there are animal legs in the Kanji for **neck**. There are NONE!;5) [[cloudstrife543](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cloudstrife543)] 30-10-2008(31): With horns on oneself, you need a strong **neck**.
乙;fish guts;The kanji shown here actually represents the "second" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternate way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among its many other meanings are "pure," "tasteful," "quaint," and - get this! - **fish guts**. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word.;* We will keep _fishhook_ as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples follow.;1) [[Jeremy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeremy)] 11-7-2006(113): This is a fish hook, that pulls out the **fishguts**.;2) [[bakamono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bakamono)] 20-8-2007(41): You cut a fish in a z shape on the belly to make it easier to open the fish and rip out its **fish guts** silly!;3) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 3-11-2007(35): "Knife goes in, guts come out" (-Bart Simpson's mantra as he guts fish in "30 Minutes Over Tokyo"). To be more specific: first, cut a 乙 -shape in the belly of the fish, **second** , pull the **fishguts** out. (Note that the most common meaning of this kanji is not 'fishguts' as Heisig connotates, but 'second').;4) [[Cruger](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cruger)] 26-7-2008(25): Fishgutz.;5) [[GrimPanda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/GrimPanda)] 21-9-2010(18): Really this will rarely be seen as **fishguts** as a Kanji, usually it's 2nd party, or latter, generally always meaning 2nd in some way. It's easy to remember this as "2nd" since it looks like a 2. Then just remember it's a fishhook primitive like any other kanji that changes it's meaning as a primitive.
乱;riot;In a **riot** , manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This kanji shows what happens to a **rioting** _tongue_ : it gets "barbed" like a _fishhook_ , and sets to attacking the opposition, to _hook_ them as it were.;;1) [[rotifera](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rotifera)] 11-11-2007(216): The **riot** police broke up the **riot** by dragging the **riot** ers away by their _tongues_ with _fishooks_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(87): A _tongue_ with a _hook_ can cause a **riot**.;3) [[lostdog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lostdog)] 20-12-2007(56): If my daughter took her _tongue_ and pierced it with a _fishhook_ , that would cause her mother and I to **riot**!;4) [[Xtophe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Xtophe)] 7-9-2006(31): During a _riot_ in a totalitarian country, the leftist's _tongues_ are _fishhooked_ by the police ( a way for me to remember that tongue is on the left of the kanji).;5) [[pollodepalo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pollodepalo)] 11-11-2008(16): **Riot** ers are punks with fish hooks in their tongues.
直;straightaway;Begin with the top two primitives, _needle_ and _eye_. Together they represent the _eye of a needle_. Below them is a _fishhook_ that has been **straightened out** and its barb removed so that it can pass through the _eye of the needle_.;;1) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 5-10-2006(333): If you get a needle in your eye that is hooked in there, get to a hospital **straightaway**.;2) [[zdude255](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdude255)] 20-3-2008(126): I caught a freaky creature with ten eyes on my fish hook, so I threw it back **straightaway**.;3) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 26-7-2007(27): "Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a _needle_ in my _eye_ "… and sit on a _fish hook_ if I ever tell a lie! Slight variant on what kids say **straightaway** if their word is put in doubt.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 22-7-2007(22): Ten eyes knew **straightaway** that there is something wrong with the hook.;5) [[ttrent](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ttrent)] 19-2-2008(17): The hook goes **straightaway** through the eye of a needle.
具;tool;Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's **tools** of all sorts, each equipped with its own _eye_ so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.;;1) [[Rinifett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rinifett)] 25-9-2007(200): Keep an eye on your **tool** s while you work at the table.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 27-8-2007(107): One **tool** nobody should be without - a Mordor-type eye that floats over the workbench. It jerks around, monitoring all who come near, and if anyone so much as removes a stapler from the bench - ZAP.;3) [[alimasag](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alimasag)] 28-10-2007(83): You need a strong **tool** to remove the legs from a shellfish.;4) [[jonmayes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonmayes)] 11-7-2008(26): You need a strong a **tool** to separate the legs from a shellfish.;5) [[wreckz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz)] 23-1-2008(19): Like my shop teacher always said… In order to use any **tool** at your _workbench_ you must first make sure to wear your safety goggles to protect your _eyes_.
真;true;Here again we meet the composite element, _eye of the needle_ , which here combines with _tool_ to give us a measure of what is **true** and what is not.;;1) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 2-10-2007(262): A compass is a _tool_ with a _needle_ on top that points to **true** north.;2) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 5-12-2007(159): _Ten_ _tools_ are all a **true** craftsman needs.;3) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 8-9-2007(57): It's **true** that I got a needle stuck in my eye once. Luckily, we had a tool to pull the needle out from my eye. **True** story.;4) [[eltheoldsoul](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltheoldsoul)] 12-9-2008(56): Ten eyes working together are the best tools to see what's **true**.;5) [[dmohamed](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dmohamed)] 4-7-2008(46): Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a _needle_ in my _eye_ is a _tool_ used by children to affirm what they said as being **true**.
工;craft;The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for **craft** in general.;* As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of _craft_ and also takes on the related meanings of _I beam_ and _artificial_.;1) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 15-11-2005(78): I consider **craft** to be one of the harder primitives to use in stories so I've personified it as Bender the **craft** y robot from Futurama who was designed to bend I-beams.;2) [[C00ki3M0nst3r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/C00ki3M0nst3r)] 29-8-2007(37): I **craft** y.;3) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 4-2-2008(30): Icraft, beautifully **craft** ed by apple!;4) [[brandon7s](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brandon7s)] 1-10-2009(23): I-beams are used to **CRAFT** skyscrapers.;5) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 22-11-2008(23): I **CRAFT** ed an _artificial I-beam_.
左;left;By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get: _by one's side_ . . . _craft_. Conveniently, the **left** has traditionally been considered the  "sinister" _side_ , where dark and occult _crafts_ are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the **left** and is longer than the first.;;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 19-2-2008(92): The **LEFT** _side_ of my brain _posesses_ the faculties needed for logical _crafts_ , like engineering.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 4-2-2008(65): The **left** _side_ of my brain, is for _crafts_.;3) [[torida](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida)] 26-5-2010(49): **FOR THOSE ABOUT TO PUZZLE OVER THE CHANGING STROKE ORDER, IT'S THIS SIMPLE:** Look at the second primitive! Here, the first stroke of _by one's side_ should match the first stroke of _craft_ so that the stroke direction alternates in writing. So 左 is written horizontal, vertical, horizontal… 右 is written vertical, horizontal, vertical… 有 is vertical, horizontal, vertical… etc. (The ONLY exception to this rule comes with elbow [[masculine/male](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/743) (#743 雄) 雄 ], which is written horizontal, vertical, vertical(ish)…).;4) [[martin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martin)] 22-11-2005(35): To remember which one is right/left, think "(l)Eft", as it contains the katakana "e".;5) [[paulk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/paulk)] 29-7-2007(24): Sinister craft is done with the **left** hand.
右;right;When thinking of the key word **right** , in order to avoid confusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double meaning here, too. Imagine a little _mouth_ hanging down by your _side_  \- like a little voice of conscience - telling you the **right** thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the **right** and be drawn slightly longer than the first.;;1) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 31-3-2011(61): The **right** hand is for putting food in your _mouth_. (The other hand is for ass-wiping!). 左右 (さゆう) : left and **right** , influence, control, domination, 右 (みぎ) : **right** hand side.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 4-2-2008(53): The **right** _side_ of my brain is for _speaking_.;3) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 28-7-2007(50): Always keep your **right** to free speech (mouth) by your side!;4) [[nesert](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert)] 27-9-2009(13): _By my side_ is a big _mouth_ who thinks they're always **right**.;5) [[hissatsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hissatsu)] 17-6-2010(7): A voice of reason _by your side_ steers you **right**.
有;possess;The picture here is of someone with a slab of _meat_ dangling _by the side_ , perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in **possession** of one's soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh _meat_ to hang _by one's side_ until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order.;;1) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 7-9-2007(221): **Possess** ed by the Earth's gravity, the moon stays by its side.;2) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 12-3-2007(47): By my side I **POSSESS** a _moon of flesh_ , better known as your big ass!;3) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 18-1-2007(32): To **possess** = have or own something. In the fight for survival in prehistoric times, the most important thing to **possess** was meat by your side which could be eaten at any time. Imagine a caveman after a hunt having meat by his side.;4) [[Jeromin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin)] 21-12-2008(29): The moon stood by my side: I was **possess** ed, a lunatic.;5) [[xzseth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xzseth)] 15-4-2009(21): With the moon at my side I transform into a werewolf. Oh no, I am **possess** ed.
賄;bribe;To the left we have the primitive for a _shellfish_ , and to the right the kanji we just learned for _possess_. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word _possess_ , and now expand your image of _shells_ to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is _possessed_ by _shells_ is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to **bribe** with a few extra _shells_.;;1) [[Jiten](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jiten)] 16-3-2006(185): To **bribe** someone, money is a necessary possession.;2) [[martinirwin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martinirwin)] 23-10-2007(162): If you possess enough shellfish, you can **bribe** anyone.;3) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 28-11-2007(58): In order to **bribe** me you will have to give me all the _clams_ you _possess_.;4) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 25-2-2008(34): A **shellfish** is not the 'right' **possession** to **bribe** with. (It's on the left).;5) [[Branduil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil)] 22-2-2006(22): If money is what possesses you, you will accept many **bribe** s.
貢;tribute;A **tribute** has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and _money_ collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard- earned _money_. Little wonder that this ancient _craft_ of getting _money_ by calling it a **tribute** has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax.;;1) [[Aploosh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aploosh)] 27-6-2007(326): "This next song is a **TRIBUTE** to a little SHELLFISH friend of mine who was tragically crushed by an I-shaped table.".;2) [[ablindmouse](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ablindmouse)] 28-8-2007(114): **Tribute** is the craft of raising money.;3) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 4-11-2007(46): I gladly pay my **tribute** to the tax collector: but what he doesn't know is that this is carely _craft_ ed _money_ \- counterfeit!;4) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 16-1-2011(45): **Tribute** is another form of taxation - a _craft_ y way of collecting " _clams_ " (money). 貢献 (こうけん) : contribution, services, 西貢 さいごん Saigon.;5) [[Po0py](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py)] 14-12-2008(36): We must pay **tribute** to the crafty shellfish who always appears in our kanji.
項;paragraph;To the right we see a _head_ and to the left an element that means _craft_. When we think of a **paragraph** , we immediately think of a _heading_ device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate _heads_ often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer's _craft_. Hence, we define **paragraphing** as the  " _heading craft_ " to remember this character.;;1) [[crazy88](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crazy88)] 19-9-2007(237): To write a **paragraph** is the _craft_ of grouping sentences on a _page_.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 5-2-2008(115): To _craft_ a _page_ well, we need **paragraph** s.;3) [[martinirwin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martinirwin)] 2-12-2007(45): Page and craft = pacraft -> paracraft, said properly as **paragraph**.;4) [[libsrone](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone)] 15-1-2009(23): Well, I tried using craft and headings and pages and none of it stuck, so: Reading a block of text that isn't broken down into **paragraph** s makes me want to hit myself in the head with an I-beam.;5) [[therapysessions](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/therapysessions)] 3-1-2009(14): A well CRAFTED PAGE is full of beautiful **PARAGRAPH** S.
刀;sword;Although this character no longer looks very much like a **sword** , it does have some resemblance to the handle of the **sword**. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us keep make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji.;* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a _dagger_. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out and takes the sense of a great and flashing _saber_ , a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (Frame 1801).;1) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 15-8-2008(134): This **SWORD** is so sharp, it can cut the top part of カ off in カタナ.;2) [[mrcool](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mrcool)] 22-5-2008(47): If you look really close this kanji looks like a person bending over touching the ground Waiting for someone to put there **sword** in his ass!;3) [[saturnine13](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saturnine13)] 3-9-2009(44): Samurai carry two **sword** s on their belt: a curved katana and a straighter, shorter wakizashi.;4) [[snifty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snifty)] 17-2-2009(15): Looks like the handle on a pirate cutlass, a kind of **sword**.;5) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 6-1-2006(14): Note : this is the kanji for the famous Japanese **sword** , also pronounced かたな (katana). As a primitive when it is compressed on the right of a kanji, its meaning becomes "saber". In that case I like to associate the image of a ninja, making sure to keep it distinct from the "samurai". The samurai would be the historical japanese warrior, while the ninja would be the more stealthy character popularised through modern martial arts movies.
刃;blade;Think of using a _dagger_ as a razor **blade** , and it shouldn't be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little _drop of_ blood clinging to the **blade**?;;1) [[thatkidpercy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy)] 16-11-2007(190): The part of a _sword_ where a _drop of blood_ can usually be found is the **blade**.;2) [[Wosret](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret)] 29-11-2008(54): **A drop of** blood on the **blade** of my sword.;3) [[Twentytw0](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Twentytw0)] 3-7-2008(11): Imagine **Blade** (Wesley Snipes) wiping the _drops_ of blood from his _sword_ after killing some vampires.;4) [[canji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji)] 31-7-2008(9): How do you know it is a real _sword_? There is a _drop_ of blood on the **blade**.;5) [[jabberwockychortles](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles)] 27-1-2009(6): There's a _drop_ of blood on the **blade** of the _sword_.
切;cut;To the right we see the _dagger_ and next to it the number _seven_ whose primitive meaning we decided would be _diced_ (Frame 7). It is hard to think of **cutting** anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a _dagger_ lying on the mantelpiece and starts _dicing_ up everything insight, starting with the hors d'oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets....;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(260): The seven samurai used their swords to **cut** their opponents.;2) [[phauna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna)] 6-1-2008(83): Seven swords **cut** better than one.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 10-10-2007(41): The _seven_ samurai used their _swords_ to **cut** vegetables. (Easier to remember if it's a little silly. Imagine the seven samurai flailing about the kitchen dangerously swinging their katanas about, to **cut** stuff up for dinner.).;4) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 25-2-2007(35): Actors filming "The Seven Samurai" respond to the director's command, "CUT!" by wielding their swords.;5) [[eigoosaka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eigoosaka)] 27-12-2008(19): Be careful!!! Snow White has gone insane and **CUT** up the SEVEN dwarfs with a DAGGER.
召;seduce;A _sword_ or _dagger_ posed over a _mouth_ is how the character for "beckoning" is written. The related but less tame key word **seduce** was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the - how shall we put it? - Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is **seducing** the small round one or vice versa.);* The primitive meaning remains the same: _seduce_. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.;1) [[arekuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arekuru)] 24-6-2008(172): A man is easily **seduce** d by a mouth to his "sword.".;2) [[cornrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow)] 1-11-2008(94): When you **seduce** a girl you can put your sword in her mouth.;3) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 2-7-2007(87): To **seduce** is to make a _sword_ of one's _mouth_.;4) [[rotifera](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rotifera)] 11-11-2007(23): To **seduce** is to accomplish with the _mouth_ what cannot (or should not) be done with a _sword_.;5) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 7-8-2008(17): 召す 【めす】 (v5s,vt) (1) to call, to send for, (2) to put on, to wear, to take (a bath), to ride in, to buy, to eat, to drink, to catch (a cold), (P) This kanji isn't anything sexual or anything. It means SUMMON/TO SEND/CALL FOR (as well as honorific form of eat/drink). STORY: A king is having a hard time EATING a piece of of meat b/c it can't fit in his MOUTH, so he CALLS FOR/SUMMONS someone to bring him his SWORD. (this keeps the eat/drink meaning of the kanji true as well).
昭;shining;Let the key word suggest **shining** one's shoes, the purpose of which is to _seduce_ the _sun_ down on them for all to see.;;1) [[erlog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erlog)] 2-7-2008(263): **Shining** is the sun's seduction.;2) [[hazelsmrf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hazelsmrf)] 9-5-2008(176): The sun was **shining** so bright that it seduced Icarus and he flew too close.;3) [[bellatora88](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bellatora88)] 27-8-2009(62): Edward Cullen SEDUCES Bella when she sees him **SHINING** in the SUN. That sparkly bastard.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(28): The knight in **shining** armour was seduced in just one day.;5) [[letrange](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/letrange)] 5-1-2008(25): The Sun Seduces with its **Shining** light.
則;rule;The character depicts a _clam_ alongside a great and flashing _saber_. Think of digging for _clams_ in an area where there are gaming **rules** governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty _saber_ , which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a _clam_ and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the **rules** say it has to be.;;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 12-10-2011(271): When you have both _money_ and the power of the _sword_ , you can make the **rules**.;2) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 4-2-2008(126): If you've got CRABs on your SABER, then you didn't follow the **rule** s of safe sex!;3) [[pazustep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep)] 1-7-2008(60): The world is **rule** d by _money_ and _sword_.;4) [[Tobberoth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tobberoth)] 23-12-2008(24): A shellfish with a sword **rule** s.;5) [[vgambit](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit)] 28-8-2008(18): Screw the **rules** , I have _money_ and a _saber_.
副;vice-;The key word **vice** has the sense of someone second-in-command. The great and flashing _saber_ to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the _wealth_ on the left combine to create an image of dividing one's property to give a share to one's **vice** - _wealth_ holder.;;1) [[geisel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/geisel)] 27-4-2007(174): The _wealthy_ guy with the _sword_ standing next to the king, that's the **vice-** roy who does all the dirty work.;2) [[applesuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki)] 10-2-2006(106): **Vice-** president Cheney: a wealthy saber rattler.;3) [[demiurge](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/demiurge)] 22-3-2008(92): **Vice-** President Cheney shot a man in the face while hunting, as is common knowledge, I imagine. So think of it like a Clue answer and you will remember the symbol order as well. _One_ shot, in the _mouth_ , on a _field_ , with a _gun_ (a modern-day sword).;4) [[Jeromin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin)] 21-12-2008(18): The Shogun's second in command, handling the wages: One mouth controlling the rice fields to pay for the swords (Japanese samurai got paid in rice).;5) [[frychiko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko)] 25-5-2008(17): The VICE president protected my WEALTH with his army of SABER wielding soldiers.
別;separate;In the Old East, the samurai and his _saber_ were never **separated**. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of **separation** -anxiety for a samurai: to be _bound up with a rope_ and unable to get at his _saber_ leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that _mouth_ bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for _tied up_ is written - just as it had been with the character for _ten thousand_.;;1) [[leviathan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/leviathan)] 20-3-2006(154): I don't know about you but to me this seems like someone's head is about to be **separate** d from his body. You can see he's kneeling and his mouth is wide open gasping for the last breath he will ever take.;2) [[thatkidpercy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thatkidpercy)] 16-11-2007(119): A wise old samurai keeps his hostages (with their _mouths bound up_ to keep them quiet) in a **separate** room from his _sabers_. Putting them together would be a silly mistake.;3) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 3-8-2007(69): The prisoner with the BOUND MOUTH was **separate** d from his SABRE.;4) [[tharvey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey)] 12-11-2009(16): They **separate** d me from the group. They gagged my _mouth_ , _bound_ me up, and threatened me with a _saber_.;5) [[canji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji)] 3-1-2010(13): In Empire Strikes Back, Luke was hanging upside down, muttered with his _mouth_ "Ben, Ben, Ben", his feet _bound_ in ice, he was **separated** from his light _sabre_. And he could hear the monster coming for him.
丁;street;The picture here is of a **street** sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any _street_ that immediately conjure sup the image of a **street** sign to you.;* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a _nail_ or a _spike_. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a _street_ sign out of the ground and using it as a _nail_ to repair your garage roof.;1) [[steves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/steves)] 10-10-2007(167): Today, the program "Sesame **Street** " is brought to you by the letter "T".;2) [[yoshi_features](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yoshi_features)] 5-4-2008(82): Two **street** s make a T-intersection.;3) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 24-9-2007(22): Any **street** with _nails_ on it had best be avoided.;4) [[Daffydus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Daffydus)] 3-6-2009(16): The **street** sign is nailed with a spike.;5) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 2-7-2007(14): The word on the **street** is, "Mr. T is a bad-ass!".
町;village;_Street_ signs standing at the corner of the _rice fields_ depict the **village** limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.);;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 19-11-2006(150): Actually this means **town** , like one that has lots of _streets_ and is surrounded by all the _rice fields_.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 20-8-2008(84): Getting this one confused with Town is easy, so remember it with this rhyme. "Pillage the **village** , for the _rice_ and and the _tea_." the street primitive on the right looks like a 't'.;3) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 25-8-2007(63): Note: the keywords of [village](../v4/92.html) (#92 町) and [town](../v4/208.html) (#208 村) swap places in translated editions of RTK I. In fact, according to different dictionaries, 町 is closer to 'town' whereas 村 is closer to 'village'.;4) [[pazustep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep)] 1-7-2008(20): _Streets_ through _rice fields_ are only found in small **villages**.;5) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 29-3-2008(13): チョウ まち A **village** /TOWN is nothing more than rice fields connected by streets.
可;can;Remember the story about the "Little Engine that **Could** " when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain - "I think I **can** , I think I **can**.... " \- spitting railroad _spikes_ out of its _mouth_ as it chews up the line to the top.;;1) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 10-10-2006(193): A mouth on the street asking for things: "Can I get some help?! **Can** I get directions, **Can** I have some money? **Can** you please speak English?!".;2) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 8-1-2008(88): I **can** eat nails.;3) [[annabel398](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/annabel398)] 17-8-2008(34): On Main STREET America, what you hear in people's MOUTHs is "Yes We **CAN**!".;4) [[Phil_Spring](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Phil_Spring)] 19-7-2009(29): A square box **can** fit in a corner.;5) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 12-2-2008(18): **Can** you _speak_ _street_? (as in street _talk_ ).
頂;place on the head;The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning "humble acceptance." Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: _nail_ . . . _head_. As in  "hitting the _nail_ on the _head_. " Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to **place on your head** a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 30-8-2007(284): If I put a _street sign_ on my _head_ what do I get ? A **place on the head** !;2) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 7-2-2008(68): _NAILS_ \- **place directly on the _fore_ head**, _NAILS_ \- **place directly on the _fore_ head**, _NAILS_ \- **place directly on the _fore_ head**, The **HEAD ON** commercial _nail_ s it into your _head_ ……;3) [[howdycowdy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/howdycowdy)] 25-2-2008(57): You've probably noticed that even the rudest and crudest Japanese say "Itadakimasu" before every meal. Why? Because each person who failed to say it as a child had a _nail_ driven straight into that tender **PLACE ON THE HEAD** (i.e. the very top of the head). That's a lesson no one will forget!;4) [[wfreeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wfreeman)] 3-2-2007(52): Driving down the STREET, looking at a PAGE in the map, I hit another car, and started bleeding from a **place on the head**.;5) [[Matty0187](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matty0187)] 30-7-2009(21): _Nail_ the _page_ to the wall! _Place_ a Bounty _On the head_.
子;child;This kanji is a pictograph of a **child** wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young **children** who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air, the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up, and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother's neck.;* As a primitive, the meaning of _child_ is retained, though you might imagine a little older _child_ , able to run around and get into more mischief.;1) [[lbphenom](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lbphenom)] 12-1-2008(43): A **child** who is _ten_ will still ask for his _ma_ (top looks a bit like katakana ma).;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 28-1-2008(30): A pictograph of a **child** , with arms outstretched for mother (or perhaps because she is chasing a rat?). Note that this kanji occupies the first space on the Zodiac circle, and is the sign for the rat (such as 2008!).;3) [[Po0py](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py)] 15-12-2008(21): A ten year old **child** with a baseball cap.;4) [[Jeromin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jeromin)] 21-12-2008(9): A **child** , from one to ten, before becoming a teen.;5) [[NyahK](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK)] 6-6-2010(6): I'd imagine most people knew this long before starting RTK. When they were still a **child** of kanji, perhaps?
孔;cavity;Probably the one thing most _children_ fear more than anything else is the dentist's chair. Once a _child_ has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word **cavity** , even though it is not likely to know that the word means "hole" until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny _hooks_ the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back.;;1) [[ssmoler](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ssmoler)] 21-6-2007(157): The child's arms flailed around at the sight of the hooked tool the dentist was going to use to fill his **cavity**.;2) [[thequietfox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thequietfox)] 20-1-2008(93): I warned him about **cavities** , but the _child_ is still _hooked_ on sweets.;3) [[ederu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ederu)] 26-11-2008(36): When a _child_ falls into a **cavity** we need a _hook_ to get them out.;4) [[RobMow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow)] 8-7-2009(19): A _child hooked_ on candy canes (sweets) is bound to get a **cavity**.;5) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 29-3-2008(10): コウ // HOLE // "Confucius pulled the child out of the hole using a big hook." 鼻孔 （びこう）nostril. 孔子 （こうし）Confucius.
了;complete;Learn this character by returning to frame 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the "arms" have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a _child_ with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully **completed**.;;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 8-9-2007(252): The experiment was a **complete** failure! The child was made without any arms!;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(73): A child with the arms inside the blanket will be **complete** ly wrapped up.;3) [[P2daGn3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/P2daGn3)] 2-6-2008(56): The child in not **complete**. He's got no arms!;4) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 23-12-2008(42): Don't be tempted to write another stroke and make 子 . This kanji, 了 , is already **complete**.;5) [[burritokun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burritokun)] 8-8-2008(21): No parent can say their child rearing is **complete** until the child stops holding out his hand for money.
女;woman;You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting **woman** drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy, being able to write it beautifully is another thing.;* The primitive meaning is the same: _woman_.;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 14-1-2007(216): To remember the order of strokes, remember a female ninja is called a "kunoichi". That is, く(hiragana) ノ(katakana) 一 (kanji, ichi=one).;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(29): My mother taught me that a **woman** should always sit with her legs crossed (but the arms can be stretched out).;3) [[UKLukeEU](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/UKLukeEU)] 30-12-2006(9): The **woman** has her legs crossed.;4) [[uumai](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uumai)] 2-1-2013(5): When a **woman** becomes a ninja she is called a kunoichi ( **くノ一** ).;5) [[dystopian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dystopian)] 20-1-2011(4): To remember the stroke order, a female ninja is called a " くノ一 ".
好;fond;The phrase "to be **fond** of someone " has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term "to **fondle**. " The character likens it to a _woman_ **fondling** her _child_.;;1) [[snozle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snozle)] 8-10-2006(182): A _woman_ is **fond** of her _child_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(13): Women are **fond** of children.;3) [[bakamono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bakamono)] 20-8-2007(7): If you are **fond** of a _woman_ , she will make you a _child_.;4) [[geisel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/geisel)] 11-11-2006(7): Your wife and child: the thing you are most **fond** of.;5) [[carperhe1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/carperhe1)] 16-7-2008(5): There is no **fond** ness greater than what a _woman_ feels for her _child_.
如;likeness;Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the _mouth_ of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a _woman_ gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a **likeness** to the _opening_ of the _woman_ from whom you were born.;;1) [[smujohnson](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson)] 17-7-2008(363): _Women_ share a common **likeness**. Their _mouth_ s are always open, whining about this and that.;2) [[At0m5k](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/At0m5k)] 21-8-2008(133): A _woman_ 's _mouth_ has the **likeness** of a vaccum cleaner, it's noisy and all it's good for is sucking. Do not confuse with [resemblance](../v4/114.html) (#114 肖). **Likeness** is purely conceptual, whereas resemblance refers to actual physical similarities.;3) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 25-9-2006(105): From a woman's other 口 comes a baby with a perfect **likeness**.;4) [[PrettyKitty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PrettyKitty)] 2-7-2007(53): As a woman with a big mouth, Angelina Jolie was a perfect **likeness** for Lara Croft.;5) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 30-6-2009(51): Women share one **likeness** : They have a big mouth! (I don't actually hold this view at all, but it does make it easy to remember).
母;mama;Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for _woman_ in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a **mama**. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother's breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language groups.;* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of _breasts_ in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.;1) [[mr_hans_moleman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mr_hans_moleman)] 5-7-2007(76): The two breasts of a momma who breastfeeds.;2) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 14-10-2007(34): This **mama** had twins, one _mouth_ for each _nipple_.;3) [[kat1420](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kat1420)] 11-3-2008(16): To remember strokes: it's a _breast_ exam: 1)start like a _woman_ 2) cross your heart (the lower right is crossed) 3) check your "nipples" 4) lift and separate (the last stroke parts the two "breasts").;4) [[DavidZ](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ)] 11-2-2010(13): _L7_ … To remember the strokes: this begins by writing "L7", which is 50s slang for "square" or uncool. (As a teenager I thought my **mama** was really square) Add the "nipples" and then use the last stroke to part the two "breasts"… 母 [はは] [、お母さん](midori://search?text=、お母さん) [おかあさん] [、母乳](midori://search?text=、母乳) [ぼにゅう] [、伯母](midori://search?text=、伯母) /叔母[おば].;5) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(13): The **mama** has two babies (drops) in the cradle.
貫;pierce;If one is asked to think of associations for the word **pierce** , among the first to come to mind is that of **piercing** one's ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: _mama_ . . . _oyster_. All you need to do is imagine **piercing** an ear so that it can hold a mother-of- pearl (actually, a _mama_ -of-pearl) you have just wrested from an _oyster_.;;1) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 12-2-2008(190): Ariel the Little Mermaid's _clamshell_ bra was held to her _breasts_ by **piercings**.;2) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 28-11-2007(67): The sad fate of _Mama_ _shellfish_ was to be captured and **pierced** to make an earring.;3) [[snozle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snozle)] 21-10-2006(40): _mama_ **pierces** her ears in order to wear pearl earrings (which come from _shellfish_ ).;4) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 3-6-2008(25): Boobs **PIERCE** D by shellfish! AAAH!!!;5) [[Samchan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Samchan)] 9-2-2009(22): "Mama" sat on a "shellfish" and it **pierce** d her bottom! Ow!
兄;elder brother;By now kanji like this one should "look like" something to you even though it is more of an "ideogram" than a "pictograph." The large _mouth_ on top and the _human legs_ below almost jump off the page as a caricature of **elder brother** , the one with the big _mouth_ (or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who  "has the say" among all the children).;* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of _teenager_ , in accord with the familiar image of the big _mouth_ and the gangling, clumsy _legs_.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(138): My **elder brother** was basically a mouth on legs when he was a teenager.;2) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 23-1-2008(22): The pac man's ( 只 ) **elder brother** has to have longer legs than his junior.;3) [[silkcherryblossoms](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/silkcherryblossoms)] 27-5-2007(15): Older teenage brothers have big mouths and long, awkward legs.;4) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 7-11-2008(10): My **elder brother** has a big MOUTH and LONG LEGS.;5) [[Teango](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango)] 8-3-2010(9): My **elder brother** always let his _mouth_ _run_.
呪;curse;For some reason, the inventor of this kanji associated a **curse** with the _mouth_ of an _older brother_. I leave it to you to decide if he is on the giving or receiving end of the sorcery.;;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 24-6-2008(107): Caution: this means a spell, not to swear. I put a **curse** on my _elder brother_ so that he can never open his _mouth_.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 14-2-2007(22): Your _older brother_ 's _mouth_ often **curses**.;3) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 13-2-2007(15): There's an ancient **curse** in this region whereby the firstborn son, i.e. the _elder brother_ , is always born with an extra _mouth_. And regardless of the elder brother's own personality, the extra mouth is bad tempered and always **cursing**.;4) [[koohiikun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun)] 21-6-2010(5): A _mouthy teenager_ is **curse** d to get into trouble time and time again.;5) [[terozen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen)] 10-2-2012(3): It's interesting how Halparn, Henshall and "Kanji Learners Dictionary" all forfeit to include this kanji, yet kana-heavy games like Final Fantasy assumes their gamer has knowledge of this kanji. Just sayin'. Story: I put a **curse** on the _mouth_ of my _older brother_ to shut him up. He's an annoying bugger, after all.
克;overcome;In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of _teenager_. The _needle_ on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the _teenager_ growing up in today's world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the _needle_ at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that "We Shall **Overcome** " the plague, will the _needle_ cease to hangover their heads, as it does in this character.;;1) [[wfreeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wfreeman)] 3-2-2007(184): Ten elder brothers can **overcome** anything.;2) [[canji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/canji)] 1-8-2008(81): A **teenager** addicted to heroine must **overcome** the _needle_.;3) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 12-2-2008(29): **Overcome** your _elder brother_ with a _needle_ to his head.;4) [[Wosret](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wosret)] 29-11-2008(24): Having **ten** older brothers would be hard to **overcome**. **Ten** mouths, and **ten** sets of legs kicking the crap out of you.;5) [[FauxSho](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FauxSho)] 16-3-2013(19): _Ten teenagers_ were chosen to **OVERCOME** all odds and save the world. The start of almost every JRPG.
小;little;The sense of **little** that this character represents is not the same as  "a little bit." That meaning comes in the next frame. Here **little** means "small" or "tiny." The image is one of three **little** _drops_ , the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: **little** , **little** , nothing but **little**.;* The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards.;1) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 3-9-2008(121): A **little** penguin with its wings at its side.;2) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 13-9-2007(37): A depressed child, head low and arms hung low, because he's too **little** to ride the roller coaster.;3) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 11-10-2006(17): Hold something **little** in-between your fingertips and it'll look like this Kanji here. :).;4) [[aquanoodle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aquanoodle)] 25-3-2008(15): **Little** **little** **little** drops…;5) [[Uli_S](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uli_S)] 10-9-2009(10): Ohh, how cute - a **little** penguin!
少;few;First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the _drop_ at the bottom that has been extended into a longer diagonal stroke leaning left. This happens because a single, isolated drop will NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the tiny _drop_ indicate a further belittling of what is already _little_ \- thus making it a **few** of something _little_.;;1) [[raseru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru)] 6-2-2008(129): Only a **few** people can make an ugly face like that.;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 3-8-2007(60): **Few** usually refers to three. To emphasize three, we underline the three drops in little.;3) [[Easytarget](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Easytarget)] 3-3-2009(27): A happy grin, after a **few** drinks.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(21): That playground has a **few** little ones sliding down the slide.;5) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 6-10-2009(18): A **few** _little penguins_ slide belly-first down an ice _slide_.
大;large;Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of **large**. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms.;* As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a _large dog_ or, if you prefer, a _St. Bernard dog_. In frame 253 we will explain why this choice was made.;1) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 13-9-2007(79): A person stretching their arms and legs to look **large** and scare a bear away.;2) [[Teango](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Teango)] 8-3-2010(23): How **large**? This **large**!;3) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(21): Think of a **large** St. Bernard dog with his paws all stretched out.;4) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 27-1-2008(13): A person ( 人 -fr.951) showing itself **large** r widening its arms.;5) [[xiteru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xiteru)] 9-10-2007(6): That volcano is so big, or **large** , it goes over the clouds (the clouds being the horizontal line).
多;many;" **Many** _moons_ ago, " begins much of Amerindian folklore - a colorful way of saying "Once upon a time" and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two _moons_  (three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time.;;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 13-2-2008(105): _Two evenings_ too **many**!;2) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 17-3-2006(46): This reminds me of a childish pseudo-confucion rhyme: "He who eats **many** prunes sits on toilet **many** _moons_ ".;3) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 3-6-2008(40): These look like the katakana "ta" therefore, There are **MANY** tatas! WOO~~~!;4) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 18-12-2007(16): The ninja waited **many** evenings for the right moment to strike.;5) [[FauxSho](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FauxSho)] 9-2-2013(13): **Many** _moons_ ago.. or perhaps it was just a couple of _evenings_ , I can't remember.
夕;evening;Just as the word **evening** adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word  "night," so the kanji for **evening** takes the ordinary looking _moon_ in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame).;* The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.;1) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 13-2-2008(113): The **evening** is young, the _moon_ is not full.;2) [[ctalbottclark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctalbottclark)] 7-3-2008(33): In the **evening** , the crescent _moon_ hangs in the sky.;3) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 23-7-2007(27): In the **evening** , I try my best to remember the katakana symbol for "TA" (ie. "ta ta!").;4) [[sprutnik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik)] 4-10-2008(19): When I come back home from work in the **evening** I say _ta_ daima.;5) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 26-11-2008(11): This **EVENING** , there is only a half- _moon_.
汐;eventide;In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning- _tide_ and the element for _drops of water_. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, **eventide** : _drops of water_ inching their way up the shore in the _evening_.;;1) [[mcdreamer374](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcdreamer374)] 1-4-2007(163): **Eventide** is just another word for evening, and it has the word tide in it which we associate with water.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 13-2-2008(72): _Drops_ of water shower the beach as the _evening_ tide approaches: **eventide**.;3) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 12-12-2007(24): **Eventide** is when the drops of water are attracted to the moon. This is the tide which occurs in the evening.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(10): In the **eventide** (nightfall), drops of water start forming in the evening.;5) [[maikunari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/maikunari)] 25-7-2006(10): The viking hordes arrive on the **eventide** , water spashes as the evening sky turn red with blood.
外;outside;On the left, the primitive for _evening_ , and on the right, that for the _magic wand_. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your _magic wand_ out into the _evening_ air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, _evening_ and _magic wand_ takes you naturally **outside**.;;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 7-7-2008(134): A young magician likes to practice **outside** in the _evening_ with his _magic wand_ (as opposed to the old magician who wakes _early_ to practice with his _wand_ in [eminent](../v4/51.html) (#51 卓)).;2) [[jondesousa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jondesousa)] 19-6-2006(77): **Outside** in the dark of evening, only a magic wand can help you.;3) [[toddiceton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/toddiceton)] 16-11-2008(58): Your _evening_ is successful if you get to pull your _wand_ **outside** your pants.;4) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 27-9-2007(15): Fairies live **outside** , and only come out in the _evening_. When they do, they wave their _magic wands_ as they dance.;5) [[DavidZ](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ)] 11-2-2010(13): All the gaikokujin ( 外国人 =" **outside** country person") guys in Roppongi on a Saturday _evening_ are looking to get their _magic wands_ polished… 外す [はずす] [、外](midori://search?text=、外) [そと] [、外国人](midori://search?text=、外国人) [がいこくじん].
名;name;Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the child's birth, to whisper into its ear the **name** he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive **naming** custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: _evening_ . . . _mouth_. At _evening_ time, a _mouth_ pronounces the **name** that will accompany one throughout life.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(165): In the evening, when it becomes dark, open your mouth to say your **name** so that people can recognise you.;2) [[panikbuton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton)] 20-1-2008(81): In the evening, her sweet mouth whispered my **name**.;3) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 2-6-2006(34): Because it's dark in the _evening_ , you need to open your _mouth_ and speak your **name** to identify yourself. (This is a traditional mnemonic for this kanji).;4) [[vinniram](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vinniram)] 24-5-2009(19): In African tradition, the father sneaks up to the baby in the EVENING, and whispers using his MOUTH the **NAME** which the baby will carry for his entire life.;5) [[jay168](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jay168)] 27-9-2009(9): My real **name** is eveningmouth, but you can call me Bob :).
石;stone;With a _mouth_ under a _cliff_ , what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great **stone** has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the _Arabian Nights_ should be enough to push the **stone** aside. But take care - the _cliff_ is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. This is the one and only time that the second stroke in _cliff_ will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.;* The _stone_ is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of _stones_ or _rocks_ of any size or shape.;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 31-12-2007(142): Indiana Jones jumps up and grabs the lip of _cliff_ just in time to evade the huge **STONE** rolling out of the _mouth_ of the cave!;2) [[Nayelianne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nayelianne)] 19-9-2008(37): There's a VERY simple way to remember this, in case the _cliff_ thing isn't working for you… Just see it as a **stone** [いし] being _hammered_ by a miner searching for jewel **stone** s [ほう **せき** ] ,).;3) [[Uli_S](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Uli_S)] 4-9-2009(33): If you pick the _right_ **stone** , and hit the kanji 右 _right_ on its head really hard, you can chip off the upper stroke from it.;4) [[ssavage2004](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ssavage2004)] 20-8-2006(22): A [mouth](../v4/11.html) (#11 口) open beneath a cliff is bound to swallow some **stone**.;5) [[zer0range](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zer0range)] 19-3-2009(14): A **stone** covers the entrance to a cave hidden under a cliff.
肖;resemblance;The word **resemblance** should suggest, among other things, a son's **resemblance** to his father. A  "chip off the old block" is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a _little_ bit of _flesh_.;* When used as a primitive, the sense of _resemblance_ is replaced by that of _spark_ or _candle_. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for _moon_ also carries a secondary sense of _fire_ , which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.);1) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 12-1-2007(246): Using DNA matching, a very little bit of flesh can be used to show the **resemblence** between family members.;2) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 29-1-2008(122): Hey baby, it might be a _little_ bit of _flesh_ now, but in a moment it'll bear a strong **resemblance** to a _candlestick_.(nudge nudge, wink wink).;3) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 19-10-2007(83): This kanji bears a **resemblance** to sparks on a candle. (I always remember the primitive, but never the original keyword.).;4) [[FloconDeNeige](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FloconDeNeige)] 19-2-2010(28): _**あやか-る**_ : to share, goodluck—Resemblance = To have LITTLE difference in the FLESH.;5) [[czaplinsky](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/czaplinsky)] 18-11-2007(18): God breathing a _sparkle_ of life into _flesh_ to make human **resemblant** to him.
硝;nitrate;The word **nitrate** should immediately suggest a beaker of **nitric** acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a _rock_ and watching the _sparks_ fly as it bores a hole through the rock.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 10-7-2007(174): That stone has sparks coming out of it! Someone must have poured **nitrate** acid on it.;2) [[Xtophe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Xtophe)] 18-9-2006(74): Salpetre is the common name for **Nitrate** coming from Latin "sal petrae" or _stone_ salt. It is also a component of gun powder so including a _candle_ in this kanji can be quite explosive!;3) [[nurupo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nurupo)] 24-4-2008(41): People I study Kanji with kept talking about some **nitrate**. I didn't even know what **nitrate** is, so I hit them with a stone so hard there were sparks flying everywhere. Months later my cell-mate in jail told me it's some sort of acid, but I didn't care any more… Thanks to this Kanji I got 30 years, thank you.;4) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 25-2-2008(18): That stone resembles **nitrate**.;5) [[bakamono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bakamono)] 30-9-2007(16): A stone containing **nitrate** and a candle are not good together.
砕;smash;We begin with the two elements on the right, _baseball_ and _needle_. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a _game of cricket_ in which a _needle_ is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a _rock_ for a ball. A **smash** hit would probably splinter the bat in all directions, and a **smashing** pitch would do the same with the _needle_ wicket.;;1) [[kendobc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kendobc)] 18-5-2008(338): To **SMASH** a STONE you need to hit it NINE or TEN times.;2) [[Shounenbat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shounenbat)] 8-10-2007(73): The Stones (the Rolling Stones) are 90 aged but they've done a new **SMASH** hit!;3) [[rotifera](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rotifera)] 12-11-2007(33): Hulk **smash**! Hulk **smash** _stone_! Hulk decimate _stone_! What does "decimate" mean, Hulk? Uh, means destroy _nine_ _tenths_ of. **SMASH**!;4) [[Clouded](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Clouded)] 27-6-2008(23): A _stone_ will **smash** a car-window _nine_ times out of _ten_.;5) [[zardoz73](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73)] 4-8-2008(17): Hulk **SMASH**! Hulk throw ROCK! Hulk hit 9 people! No! Hulk hit 10 people! Bad people! Hulk **smash**!
砂;sand;Good **sand** for beaches has _few_ or no _stones_ in it. That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don't have to watch our step as we cavort about.;;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 31-5-2006(143): Here's how I remember that _stone_ is on the left. This is because **sand** starts as _stones_ , and only later they become _few_.;2) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 26-11-2008(112): In good **SAND** , _stones_ are _few_ , if any.;3) [[nagisa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nagisa)] 5-3-2007(28): Over time, _rocks_ are worn down into just a _few_ grains of **sand**.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(27): To make **sand** , start by grinding a few stones.;5) [[dshill99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99)] 4-6-2009(11): **Sand** has _stones_ _few_ and far between. 砂 【すな】 (n) **sand** , grit, 砂糖 【さとう】 (n) sugar,.
妬;jealous;It should not be hard to leep from the key word to the image of a _woman_ who is **jealous** of the _rock_ that another _woman_ is sporting on the third finger of her left hand.;;1) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 18-5-2007(75): The **jealous** _woman_ bashed the brains in of the guy who betrayed her, with a _stone_.;2) [[oregum](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum)] 6-11-2011(14): WOMEN are **JEALOUS** of the STONE on my wife's ring.;3) [[Neobeo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo)] 9-1-2009(5): I'm **jealous** that my _woman_ has a crush on _The Rock_.;4) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 10-12-2008(4): A **jealous** _woman_ is as cold and hard as a _rock_.;5) [[meeatcookies](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meeatcookies)] 24-8-2012(3): The _woman_ is **jealous** of her man, the _rock_ star.
削;plane;Long before the invention of the carpenter's **plane** , people used knives and machetes (or here, _sabers_ ) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can **plane** a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the _sparks_ fly from their _sabers_.;;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 21-12-2007(258): _Sparks_ will fly if you attempt to **PLANE** your _sabre_.;2) [[snozle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snozle)] 21-10-2006(85): With today's strict air regulations, carrying a _sabre_ onto a **plane** could _spark_ quite a commotion.;3) [[LazyNomad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad)] 21-2-2010(62): Not " _a **plane** "_, but _"to **plane** "_. To carve a sculpture from wooden block, you cut it (with a _sword_ ) little by little, until there is _resemblance_ with whatever it was meant to _resemble_.;4) [[sprutnik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik)] 4-10-2008(36): The carpenter's **plane** _resembles_ a _saber_.;5) [[ederu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ederu)] 15-12-2008(12): _sparks_ fly from the _blade_ as they **plane** the surface to perfection.
光;ray;There are really only 2 primitives here, _little_ and _human legs_. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn't make sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner's eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of  "dust" are that dance around in the light- **rays** that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as _little_ and disembodied _human legs_ , and you should have no trouble with this character.;;1) [[guidedog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog)] 9-2-2007(132): A **ray** of light is not a wave but made of _little_ photons with _human legs_.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 27-9-2007(86): The **ray** from Honey I Shrunk the Kids made people _little_ \- ha! look at them run around on their tiny _legs_!;3) [[cloudstrife543](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cloudstrife543)] 1-11-2008(47): Imagine a **ray** gun shooting someone and their body exploding (sparks) and just their legs left.;4) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 25-2-2008(30): **Little legs** at play are a **ray** of light in my day.;5) [[oRis1024](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024)] 20-7-2008(24): **Ray** is _tiny_ _legs_ of light…
太;plump;" **Plump** " is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample- bodied person falling into a sofa like a _large drop_ of oil plopping into a fishbowl - kerrrr- **plump**!;;1) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 3-8-2007(152): A _large_ person with a big _drop_ of sweat dripping off of him because he is so **plump**.;2) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 27-2-2006(80): Fat("plump") men always have small penises…..the kanji is a combination of "large" with a drop(representing the small penis between his legs).;3) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 28-1-2008(36): A big, **plump** sumo wrestler with a loincloth covering his little drop. (Thanks Fabrice).;4) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 5-2-2006(19): To keep this distinct from the primitive meaning of "round" ("fat man") I suggest to use a specific image, such as that of a **plump** Japanese sumo wrestler, and let the _drop_ between the legs be the loincloth (which compared to their _large_ body size, is quite a _drop_ ). To illustrate the importance of this, have a look at the kanji for "tenacious" (frame 1506) and "burdensome" (frame 1986).;5) [[ctalbottclark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ctalbottclark)] 8-3-2008(15): The **plump** _dog_ _drop_ ped its tail between its legs.
器;utensil;The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy _St. Bernard dog_ stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty _mouth_ , waiting for the **utensils** to arrive so the feast can begin.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 2-9-2007(184): Imagine four hungry _mouths_ all sitting around the table. They are all banging their **utensils** on the table waiting for a _big_ meal to be placed in the centre.;2) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 16-4-2008(53): Note: 器 by itself means **container/caliber/vessel**. And 食器 means eating **utensil** s ("food container", hehe).;3) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 26-2-2008(39): Four _mouths_ sit at the four corners of the table, waiting for their **utensil** s, ready to devour the large, spread eagled St. Bernard stretched out on the table!;4) [[lee101](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101)] 28-7-2011(25): I swear RevTK has got too politically correct, I mean people on here are copying Heisig's original story only shortening it which is fine, yet they are getting dislikes, only due to the fact its about eating a dog!? Other instances include where people make slight reference to sex, race, violence - Heisig clearly states that it's fine to do this. (part 1, part two on the next frame).;5) [[squirrelscuba](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squirrelscuba)] 14-5-2010(13): Four jgirl's mouths surrounding my large **utensil**.
臭;stinking;This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world. Our friend the _St. Bernard_ is alive and well, its _nose_ in the air sniffing suspiciously after something **stinking** somewhere or other.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(172): The ST. BERNARD DOG lifted his large NOSE high in the air to find out where the **stinking** smell comes from.;2) [[ageru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ageru)] 21-1-2008(54): When _I_ is _big_ , Ego **stinking**.;3) [[allanh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/allanh)] 26-6-2008(45): _I_ have just done a _big_ one. It's really **stinking**.;4) [[jannahj](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jannahj)] 17-8-2007(33): If you put your NOSE directly on top of a ST. BERNARD, you'd surely be able to smell it's **stinking** wet fur.;5) [[NyahK](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK)] 4-11-2009(16): Should one let _oneself_ get too _large_ , bodily functions may start **stinking**!
嗅;sniff;You have seen those scratch'n' **sniff** advertisements for perfumes. This one is for a _mouth_ wash that replaces one _stinking_ oder with another.;;1) [[gavmck](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck)] 27-6-2010(30): **Smell**. _Mouth_ agape, _nose_ in the air, a _chihuahua_ **smells** some BBQ miles away. NOTE: Assigned keyword "sniff" in RTK Newly Approved General Use Kanji Supplement.;2) [[thecite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite)] 8-12-2009(16): **smell** : You open your mouth and gasp for air, that stinking (notice the chihuahua instead) smell is too much.;3) [[aaroncp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp)] 6-2-2011(9): You open your _mouth_ and gasp for air, 1 **sniff** of that _stinking_ chihuahua is too much. *Edited thecite's to reflect the keyword in the supplement.;4) [[spleenlol](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/spleenlol)] 7-10-2010(7): Only 12 strokes. Dot over dog is not there anymore.;5) [[lucidthoughts](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucidthoughts)] 28-7-2012(6): Your mouth stinks: you need to **sniff** your breath.
妙;exquisite;The primitive for _woman_ is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for _few_. When we refer to a _woman_ as **exquisite** , we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but _few_ and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word **exquisite** carries this same sense of  "seeking out" the rare from the ordinary.;;1) [[amthomas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amthomas)] 11-6-2007(305): **Exquisite** _women_ are _few_ and far between.;2) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 27-1-2008(44): A geisha is an **exquisite** and **delicate** (another meaning of this kanji) women, however, even in the past there was only few of them.;3) [[oohansel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oohansel)] 16-4-2009(31): **Exquisite** women are few.;4) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 5-11-2009(16): All WOMEN are beautiful, only a FEW are **EXQUISITE** …;5) [[oRis1024](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024)] 20-7-2008(7): _Women_ have **exquisite** taste - they only like _few_ things.
省;focus;When we think of **focusing** on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our _eye_ on a _few_ important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a _few_ things and holding them before one's _eye_ in order to **focus** on them better.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(251): You **focus** by concentrating your _eye_ on _few_ er objects.;2) [[smujohnson](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson)] 26-8-2008(48): To remember the order: When **focusing** , keep a _few_ things your TOP priority, so only they come UNDER your _sight_.;3) [[Xtophe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Xtophe)] 7-9-2006(41): Success (or survival?) method for accelerated juggling course: _focus_ on a _few_ nitroglycerine filled juggling balls flying OVER your _eyes_ —(I have trouble with this _few_ primitive that can be anywhere in a kanji. To build in its location in the story is important somehow).;4) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 27-5-2009(22): _Few_ distractions will catch your _eye_ if you have **FOCUS**.;5) [[stehr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr)] 30-9-2007(12): _few_ people can **focus** their _eyes_ perfectly, that is 20/20, the rest of us have to wear glasses because we see out of **focus**.
厚;thick;When we refer to someone as **thick** -skinned or **thick-** headed, we are usually quick to add - even if only under our breath - something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for **thick** depicts a _child_ abandoned out on the wild _cliffs_ , exposed to the heat of the _sun_ , and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as **thick** as the parent who left it there.;;1) [[potempkin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin)] 26-8-2008(209): The **thick** _cliff_ walls protected the _children_ from the _sun_.;2) [[kfactor](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kfactor)] 7-7-2007(142): In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff. Under the Sun, they fight other Children. In the end, if they survive, they sure have **thick** skin.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 28-9-2007(28): **Thick** skinned _child_ , got that way by burning under the _sun_ while playing at the bottom of a _cliff_ which reflects and intensifies the light. (He's safe though, because there's no overhang).;4) [[theBryan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theBryan)] 30-5-2008(25): The japanese word for **thick** is atsui which is a homophone for hot, a kid under a cliff with the sun baking down on him would be hot indeed, especially if he had a **thick** sweater on. An atsui seetaa under the atsui sun.;5) [[dinmamma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dinmamma)] 9-8-2009(14): A _child_ who grew up under the burning _sun_ on dry, bare _cliffs_ is bound to be **thick** -skinned.
奇;strange;The elements we are given to work with here are _St. Bernard dog_ and _can_. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word _can_. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along)  to stick closely to the elements, in this case, _mouth_  and _nails_. Now all we need do is create a fictitious  " **Strange** But True " column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a _St. Bernard_ whose _mouth_ has been _nailed_ shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard.;;1) [[Beeber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Beeber)] 12-6-2007(238): I find it **strange** that so many people commit suicide in Tokyo by throwing themselves in front of the train. To me when I look at this kanji, I see a train just about to come out of a tunnel, and above the man waiting for his oppourtunity where he can end it all.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(77): Imagine a ST. BERNARD DOG carrying a CAN instead of a barrel in rescue missions. How **strange**!;3) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 12-12-2007(58): A _dog_ that _can_ do the "Can Can" would be a **STRANGE** sight indeed.;4) [[Shishimai](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shishimai)] 22-1-2006(26): It's 'strange' to see a St. Bernard driving 'The Little Engine That Could'.;5) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 20-8-2008(18): A _St. Bernard_ that _can_ eat _nails_?! How **strange**!
川;stream;We have taken the image of a river **stream** over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a **stream**.;* As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of _stream_ the more vivid image of a _flood_. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements: on the left, it is written the same. on the top, it is written with the three strokes more like less-then signs on the bottom, it is written with the third stroke similar to a fishhook;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 2-9-2007(86): So as not to confuse this with [river](../v4/146.html) (#146 河) think of **stream** ers falling down.;2) [[dogen2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2)] 17-3-2007(63): There are _three_ default I/O **Streams** in UNIX, stdin, stdout, and stderr.;3) [[aquanoodle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aquanoodle)] 25-3-2008(18): _Three_ **stream** s grouped together might cause a flood!;4) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 27-2-2008(14): **Stream** ers, **stream** ing down.;5) [[a_d_g](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/a_d_g)] 8-10-2008(8): In Ghostbusters, Egon warned that crossing the **streams** would result in total proton reversal, that's why the lines should not intersect.
州;state;Here we see _drops of_ land (little islets) rising up out of a _stream_ , creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater. Ever wonder how the **state** -line is drawn between **states** separated by a river? If there were little _drops of_ land as in the kanji, there'd be nothing to it.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(202): There were 3 little islands in the _stream_ who all decided to set themselves up as independent **states**.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 29-3-2008(28): シュウ The original meaning of this character was "sandbar", and for me this conjures up images of the Mississippi River, which is very wide with many sandbars and which was used to define the borders in ten American **state** s. Picture Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer floating by **state** after **state** as they adventure down the mighty Mississippi, occasionally beaching their raft on sandbars.;3) [[alatown](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown)] 21-2-2009(15): All powerful **STATE** S grew from a few small settlements along RIVER.;4) [[panikbuton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/panikbuton)] 20-1-2008(12): Three votes in a **state** election are as meaningless as as many drops in a stream.;5) [[cyberclops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cyberclops)] 17-1-2010(7): The **state** of a _stream_ is not changed by adding three _drops_.
順;obey;In primitive language, this character would read _stream_ . . . _head_. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of **obey**. Either one **obeys** the person who is _head_ of an organization or else **obeys** by following the _stream_ of opinion ( "current" practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji.;;1) [[steves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/steves)] 10-10-2007(185): "Obey, **Obey**!" says the brain-washing scientist as he sends a _stream_ of orders to fill your _head_.;2) [[jonny49cc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonny49cc)] 4-7-2008(92): **Obey** the orders streaming down from head office.;3) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 17-4-2008(59): An ancient form of militaristic torture: I'll hold your _head_ in the _river_ until you **obey**. Or, if you'd prefer, to get the order of primitives correct: In the _stream_ I'll dunk your _head_ until you **obey**.;4) [[skellyfish](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish)] 9-12-2008(53): In Japan, **obey** ing means following the _stream_ of collective opinion BEFORE using your own _head_.;5) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 23-8-2008(21): 順 【じゅん】 (adj-na,n,n-suf) order, turn, (P) "Your book must have its PAGES in ORDER so that the story flows as clear as a STREAM".
水;water;This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of **water**  \- not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for **water**. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a _walking stick_ being dropped vertically into the **water** , sending _droplets_ out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.;* As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 8-11-2007(67): The kanji for **water** is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes, constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig's story doesn't do this).;2) [[CandyCane](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CandyCane)] 5-10-2008(54): For those having issues with this* "A 7K foot pool of **water** " Notice it looks like a 7, and a K. Might have to practice writing it a few times.;3) [[Ozmos](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ozmos)] 10-9-2009(34): When you squeeze a stream you get **water**.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 24-7-2007(6): Dropping a hooked walking stick into the **water** causes a splash. (The primitive is often contracted to just two drops and a walking stick).;5) [[foros](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/foros)] 7-3-2010(4): Dropping the _walking stick_ into the **water** sent out _droplets_ in 4 directions.
氷;icicle;The appearance of the primitive for _water_ in its full form tells us that we have something to do with _water_ here. The extra _drop_ to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a _walking stick_ dropped into _water_ to form an **icicle**. If it helps, when you hold an **icicle** up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji.;;1) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 28-8-2007(238): **Icicle** s start with 1 frozen _drop_ of _water_.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 27-2-2008(73): _A drop_ in temperature turns _water_ into an **icicle**.;3) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 22-2-2008(15): Ooooh (う） Look at the drops of water from that **icicle**. (Hiragana う looks like the left side).;4) [[haole](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haole)] 27-10-2009(8): Just as you dot the "i" in **icicle** , so should you dot the water!;5) [[undead_saif](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undead_saif)] 29-1-2009(7): **Icicle** s form when water drops drop down on each other and freeze. look <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icicle>.
永;eternity;This kanji also uses the full form of _water_ , though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with _water_. Remember what William Blake said about seeing  "infinity in a grain of sand and **eternity** in an hour "? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see " **eternity** in a _drop of water_. ";;1) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 7-9-2007(177): It would take an **eternity** to count all the drops of water.;2) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 3-8-2007(50): It takes but one _drop_ from the most special _water_ : the fountain of youth (and it is written in a special way to with an extra horizontal line on the top) to live for an **eternity**. (In order to remember that the drop is at the top, think that the drop must come from the topmost water in order for its effects to be true).;3) [[lucianreign](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign)] 22-11-2006(36): What is your life? A DROP of water on a mini FLOOR when compared to **ETERNITY**!;4) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 22-2-2008(28): It will take **ETERNITY** for that drop of water above to drip. Especially since theres a ledge below it…;5) [[tharvey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey)] 25-1-2009(16): The _drop_ hung on the ledge above the _water_ for an **eternity**.
泉;spring;Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling **spring** of _water_ , and you will probably notice how the top of the **spring** you are thinking of, the part where the  "bubbling" goes on, is all _white_. Happily, the _white_ is just where it should be, at the top, and the _water_ is at the bottom.;* We will keep this image of a _spring_ when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for _water_ ) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for _little_.;1) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 3-8-2007(181): _White_ is a symbol of purety, so _white_ _water_ is pure water, the precise definition of **spring** water.;2) [[hikarudo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hikarudo)] 19-8-2008(123): Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot **spring**. The kanji is an excellent image of someone enjoying a Japanese hot **spring** : a little _white_ towel on top, _water_ below. (This helps keep all associations: **spring** , little and onsen).;3) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 18-2-2008(43): A fresh **SPRING** has plenty of frothy _white_ bubbles in its crisp, cool _water_.;4) [[dshill99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99)] 3-2-2008(23): A **spring** has _white_ frothy _water_.;5) [[akane99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akane99)] 8-7-2010(7): When **SPRING** comes, _white_ snow melts and becomes _water_.
腺;gland;Dig into your _flesh_ and pull out a lymph **gland**. Now give it a squeeze and watch the _spring_ of lymph spout out of it.;;1) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 15-2-2007(88): A _body part_ that acts like a _spring_ for hormones is a **gland**.;2) [[CasualTatsumaki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki)] 2-4-2010(17): Sweat and saliva **gland** s act like a spring for fluids. (combining everyone's stories in one mnemonic, thanks mantixen).;3) [[enryu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enryu)] 28-8-2009(4): Part of your body that springs out sweat, your sweat **gland** s.;4) [[Hazevi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hazevi)] 20-11-2011(2): If you were to dig into your FLESH and pull out a lymph **GLAND** , a lot of WHITE WATER will SPRING forth from it.;5) [[Louismi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Louismi)] 18-4-2011(1): Part of the body that acts as a spring of body fluids.
原;meadow;Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the **meadow** you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain **meadow** in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of  "The Sound of Music" will help.) Simply think of little _springs_ bubbling up across the **meadow** to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous _cliff_. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the _springs_ , and then falling headlong over the _cliff_ , you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory.;;1) [[brian44](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brian44)] 28-8-2007(148): Follow the _springs_ down the _cliff_ and you will find a nice **meadow**.;2) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 7-2-2008(73): Sorry about this, but Heisig was stupid calling this kanji **meadow** , used in composite words the most common meaning is **ORIGIN** … To remember just think that life may have begun in _pound_ s or _spring_ s in a land with many _cliff_ s … Just to answer correctly the review lessons think of **meadow** as the _origin_ of a huge forest.;3) [[Pangolin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pangolin)] 16-4-2009(62): Forget about "spring" because the water primitive is abbreviated to "little". This is easy to forget by the time you've finished RTK1. Instead, imagine standing on an exceedingly high _cliff_. Not overlooking the sea, but overlooking **meadow** s. And what on earth are those _white little_ things? Wow, they're sheep! This cliff must be really high!;4) [[findus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/findus)] 22-10-2007(57): When in a **meadow** , the japanese girls who are _white_ and _small_ search for the shadow of a _cliff_ to avoid taning.;5) [[mazel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mazel)] 29-8-2007(26): [L2]. Under a CLIFF is a **meadow** with WHITE SMALL flowers.
願;petition;A _meadow_ and a _head_ are all we are given to work with in the kanji for **petition**. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz _head_ located in the middle of the flowery _meadow_ we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, **petitioning** for whatever it is they want. (The scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?);;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(310): Let's **petition** to save that beautiful MEADOW from overdevelopment by signing on this PAGE.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 9-11-2007(107): Japanese hippies **PETITION** to save a _meadow_ by getting people on the street to sign their _page_ \- as you pass by they call out: " [お願いします、おねがいします。”](midori://search?text=お願いします、おねがいします。”) .;3) [[ketsensei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ketsensei)] 10-2-2013(32): Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion cross the _**meadow**_ to get to the large _**head**_ that is Oz and make their **PETITION** s for brains, heart, courage and a way home.;4) [[shorinsakka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shorinsakka)] 20-6-2007(24): In the meadow a giant head has appeared. Everyone signs a **petition** so that it won't eat everyone.;5) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 3-3-2008(19): To save the _meadow_ from development, a _page_ of signatures was submitted as a **petition**.
泳;swim;The primitive to the left, you will recall from Frame 137, represents _water_. To the right, we see the kanji for _eternity_. Knowing how much children like **swimming** , what could be a better image of _eternal_ bliss than an endless expanse of _water_ to **swim** in without a care in the world?;;1) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 18-3-2008(163): If you don't know how to **swim** , you'll be in that _water_ for _eternity_.;2) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 18-8-2007(72): With that much WATER (2 actually) you would need to **swim** for an ETERNITY.;3) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 18-10-2006(35): It'll seem like an eternity in the water if you cannot **swim**.;4) [[crd88](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crd88)] 12-4-2010(14): There's enough _water_ in the world to **swim** for _eternity_.;5) [[activeaero](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/activeaero)] 20-8-2008(11): Michael Phelps can **SWIM** for "eternity" if you give him enough "water".
沼;marsh;Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the **marsh** lands are low and near a source of _water_ that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes **marshy** is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to _seduce_ the _water_ over to its side. But, like most inordinate _seductions_ , the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy **marsh**.;;1) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 19-10-2006(175): The **marsh** lands near Mordor seduce Frodo into gazing upon them, and he falls into the water–splash!;2) [[dshill99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99)] 3-2-2008(156): A **marsh** is where _water_ is _seduced_ into the ground.;3) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(42): The **marsh** looks just like dry land. Really it's _water_ and it _seduces_ people to step onto it and they sink to their death.;4) [[mattoc_g](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattoc_g)] 28-3-2006(17): A **marsh** maid (similar to a mermaid) seduces men into her watery area.;5) [[rejam](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rejam)] 23-8-2007(8): **Marsh**. To where all the _water_ was _seduced_ to.
沖;open sea;This kanji could hardly be simpler. The key word **open sea** readily suggests being out _in the middle of_ a great body of _water_ .Thinking of it in this way should avoid confusion with the kanji for  "open," which we will meet later on.;;1) [[zdnks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdnks)] 31-10-2007(141): **Open sea** is a lot of water in the middle of nowhere.;2) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 9-3-2009(69): _Water_ in the _middle_ of the ocean is referred to as **open sea**.;3) [[akimoto](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto)] 21-6-2006(23): Out in the water, in the middle of the ocean, is **open sea** with no land for miles and miles.;4) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 4-8-2007(18): OpIN sea.;5) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 30-7-2008(5): When you are on the **OPEN SEA** , you are completely _in_ the _middle_ of the _water_.
汎;pan-;The sense of the key word here is the "all-inclusive" we find in terms like " **Pan-** American Games." (It is also the character used in mathematics for "partial" as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a _water_ sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region's most _mediocre_ athletes, many of whom cannot even tread _water_. Now try to find a sponsor for the  " **Pan-** _Mediocre_ _Water_ Sports Competition. ";;1) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 23-1-2009(54): This is **pan** \- as in the prefix meaning "all". I think of **Pan** gea as being a mediocre continent with water covering the rest of the planet. This was before it broke up into the first-class, well-distributed continents we got now.;2) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 17-6-2007(22): Yeah, all our _water_ is fairly _mediocre_ , but if we work together in some **pan** -continental union, we can make some better _water_! As if.;3) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 9-6-2009(20): After **Pan** -Am crashed yet another plane into the _water_ , their reputation dropped to _mediocre_.;4) [[dancingblade](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dancingblade)] 14-7-2010(6): A person sneezes. The _water drops in the wind_ are about to start a **pan** demic and put the whole world in **pan** demonium.;5) [[FoxintheStars](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars)] 30-7-2010(5): **Pan-** Am was such a lousy airline, even the _water_ in their in-flight meals was _mediocre_.
江;creek;Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the **creek** is often no more then a dribble of _water_ trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of _water_ is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how **creeks** are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of _water_ somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The **creek** is thus a lesson in _water-craft_ , as this kanji would agree.;;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 12-12-2007(136): A **CREEK** is a small trail of _water_ easily _craft_ ed with a stick.;2) [[nwatkins](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nwatkins)] 18-9-2007(83): **Creek** s are small water, easily crossed with a simple i-beam.;3) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 21-12-2007(35): Using _water_ and some _craft_ , one can make a **creek**.;4) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 15-3-2007(24): This Kanji can carry the meaning of "creek", "inlet", or "bay" actually. Although the meaning of inlet and bay seem to pop up for me more than instances of it meaning **creek** (I often question Hesig's choices of these key words, even if his method does seem to be effective). Still… I guess right now I'm using the image of a witch who practices her "craft" next to a watery **creek** leading into an inlet/bay.;5) [[kirihitokiri](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirihitokiri)] 9-3-2008(19): It is best to practice operating _water_ _craft_ in a **creek** before going to rivers or the sea…
汰;cleanse;This character can mean both to **cleanse** and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly _plump_ going to a skinny spa whose medicinal _waters_ promise to **cleanse** him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the _water_.;;1) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 28-11-2008(71): I couldn't find any reference to this kanji as meaning **cleanse**. It seems to be most often used in the following compound 沙汰 （さた）to mean affair. The other meanings seem to be closer to 'select' so maybe Heisig meant **cleanse** in the ethnic sense here.. I'm going to use the keyword "selection", as in natural selection. Story: natural selection first began in the water, and those that were too plump were selected out.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 24-7-2009(27): _Water_ is used to **cleanse** a _plump_ man's colon.;3) [[brendanmacdonald](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald)] 29-9-2008(13): If you are FAT, it takes more WATER to **CLEANSE** you.;4) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 27-4-2008(6): The [plump](../v4/120.html) (#120 太) goes one a **cleansing** diet to restore his health. Each day he drinks his 3l of _water_ , swim half a hour in _water_ …;5) [[Doodsaq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Doodsaq)] 5-8-2009(4): The very plump man selected the Japanese toilet seat which will **cleanse** him with water automatically since he's too fat to reach back and wipe… (consider herman's explanation and think of "selection").
汁;soup;To make **soup** , one begins with _water_ and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick **soup** or stew called  "seven-in-one" is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a _ten_ -ingredient **soup**.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(169): To make **soup** you just take _water_ and _add_ (+) the rest of your ingredients.;2) [[ostracon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ostracon)] 4-12-2007(158): To make **soup** you just take _water_ and _add_ _ten_ tasty ingredients.;3) [[silkcherryblossoms](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/silkcherryblossoms)] 10-6-2007(18): Water and ten ingredients can become a good **soup**!;4) [[samesong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong)] 28-6-2008(15): This **soup** is just water and needles - I can't eat this.;5) [[Filanator](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filanator)] 18-2-2009(5): _Water_ is _ten_ times less tasty than **soup**.
沙;grains of sand;We have already learned the kanji for _sand_ (Frame 122), so let's use it to remember the character for **grains of sand**. Instead of the  "few stones" that make for nice sand, here we have a _few drops of water_ , one for each **grand of sand** \- a beach in perfect ecological balance.;;1) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 15-7-2009(58): To keep this separated from [sand](../v4/117.html) (#117 砂): _Water_ erodes away stone a _few_ **grains of sand** at a time until there is no stone left.;2) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 15-2-2007(31): Wet sand is simply sand but to see beautiful **grains of sand** , the _water_ must be _few_.;3) [[Peppi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi)] 22-5-2009(18): Each _water_ wave washes away a _few_ **grains of sand**.;4) [[decals](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals)] 8-10-2010(5): This kanji is used in a lot of girl’s names. 理沙 (りさ) [、沙織](midori://search?text=、沙織) (さおり) [、沙百合](midori://search?text=、沙百合) (さゆり). Maybe guys can think of this kind of like the classic advice there a lots of fish in _water_ (ocean), lots of girls out there for you. You might think that it's hopeless and there are only _a few_ girls out there, but girls are like **grains of sand**. Keep looking for the right one!;5) [[Aerin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin)] 15-4-2008(5): Where there are many **grains of sand** there are _few_ drops of _water_.
潮;tide;Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own.... On the left is the _water_  \- that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for _morning_ learned back in Frame 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word **tide** , just think of it in connection with the character for _eventide_ that we learned back in Frame 115. Here we have the _morning_ - **tide** , its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(205): The morning **tide** is basically, well, WATER in the MORNING.;2) [[Mesqueeb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb)] 19-4-2009(46): If it's not Eventide ( 汐 ) it must be _morning_ **tide**!;3) [[shimouma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma)] 12-6-2008(46): This is not the eventide, but the water of the morning **tide**.;4) [[dogen2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2)] 17-3-2007(20): The water rises with the morning **tide**.;5) [[kyotokanji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyotokanji)] 28-3-2007(13): Imagine falling asleep drunk on the beach, you wake up quickly in the morning as the water from the **tide** hits you and makes you wet.
源;source;With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see _water_ and _meadow_ in this character for **source**. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word  "surge") and in popular usage, **source** suggests the place _water_ comes from. In this kanji, it is under the _meadow_ , where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little _springs_.;;1) [[dogen2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dogen2)] 17-3-2007(146): The _water_ that flows from the _meadow_ is the **source** of life for the wild antelope.;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 14-8-2006(74): The **source** of clean _water_ is from the [meadow](../v4/134.html) (#134 原): it comes from that _spring_ at the bottom of the _cliff_. Pay no attention to Julie Andrews lying face down in _spring_. The water's clean. Trust me.;3) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 11-2-2009(65): _Water_ is the **source** of a _meadow_ 's beauty.;4) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 11-11-2007(31): Here the **SOURCE** of water is deep beneath the ground ( _cliff_ ) - it seeps up, joins the water _springs_ , flows through the meadow, and down the waterfall at the end. (NOTE- to keep **spring** (133) and **source** separate, remember that a spring can be anywhere above ground, but the **source** of water is deep beneath the ground ( _cliff_ ), and flows up through the ground to join springs and streams - which is why there are two primitives for _water_ in this kanji).;5) [[rgravina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rgravina)] 20-5-2007(23): Bottled _water_ companies assure us that the **source** of their water is from some beautiful _meadow_ -spring in the Swiss Alps, but we all know they just bottle up tap water.
活;lively;When we speak of a **lively** personality or a **lively** party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of **lively** by having _tongues_ babble and splash around like flowing _water_.;;1) [[etpan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan)] 18-5-2008(201): I'm sure I can get her pretty **lively** and _wet_ using my _tongue_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(176): Conversations can become more **lively** after everyone has had a few drinks. It's because " _water_ y _tongue_ s" loosen lips!;3) [[AryllWind](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AryllWind)] 31-1-2008(23): This keyword makes me think of animals. I picture a big dog running through the grass, saliva dripping from his tongue.;4) [[grivitz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/grivitz)] 4-8-2006(19): Water comes off the **lively** speaker's tongue.;5) [[mezbup](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup)] 26-9-2008(16): **Lively** tongues need water.
消;extinguish;Among the many things _water_ is useful for is **extinguishing** fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the _water_ at the left as the _drops of water_ that are used to depict _water_ in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to **extinguish** a fire would be to see that each _drop of water_ hits one _spark_ of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(127): To **extinguish** a SPARK, you need WATER.;2) [[zdnks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdnks)] 31-10-2007(55): You need a few drops of water to **extinguish** the candle.;3) [[Sevenhelmets](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sevenhelmets)] 3-6-2008(44): To **extinguish** fire, use _water_ or something _resembling_ it.;4) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 5-8-2007(14): Each _drop of water_ **extinguish** es a _spark_ from the fire, causing the campfire to eventually **dissapear** , with the _moon_ remaining the only thing sure ( しょう) to(き) keep it light.;5) [[hotsw4p](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotsw4p)] 12-12-2009(12): Use _water_ to **extinguish** that _spark_ before it gets out of hand.
況;but of course;This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrase sand sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase **but of course**. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a _teenager_ , and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. "Did you have a good shower?" " **But of course** ," you reply, annoyed. So _water_ and _teenager_ combine to give us **but of course**.;;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 21-9-2006(174): If you ask your _teenager_ if what he's drinking is _water_ (and not Vodka), he will answer "but of course".;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 10-4-2008(137): キョウ **But of course** , this character really means "situation/condition". "Elder brother gulped some water and said, 'What the hell was Heisig's mental CONDITION when he came up with this definition? Heisig must have a drinking CONDITION. **But of course** , if Heisig sticks to water, rather than sake (like me, _water_ quaffing, situation assessing, sober _elder brother_ ), his SITUATION may improve.'" [MODEL COMPOUND: 状況 (じょうきょう) state of affairs, conditions].;3) [[icamonkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey)] 15-9-2008(61): A wet teenager is good , **but of course** it is illegal.;4) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 12-2-2008(52): Would you like to throw _water_ on your _elder brother_? **But of course**!;5) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 11-12-2006(35): This kanji is actually used the normally in the words " 況して " and " 況や ", which mean "Even more so…" or "Even less so…" depending on the context. So, everyone should use _water_ to clean themselves, _even more so_ _teenagers_ prone to body odors.
河;river;The character in this frame represents a step up from the _stream_ we met in Frame 134, it is a full-sized **river**. The _water_ to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the _can_ at the right tells us that our  "little engine that _could_ " has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip' like a regular riverboat.;;1) [[gsantise](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise)] 25-8-2007(175): A **river** CAN exist only if there is WATER.;2) [[Avispa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Avispa)] 29-8-2007(85): I kept confusing this with _stream_. My Japanese friend said that to him this is for an artificial **river**. Looking at kanji compounds with this there are two that struck me: One is the Yellow **River** in China ( 黄河 ), and the other is the Milky Way ( 銀河 ). Now I either think of the Little Engine that _could_ dragging a bunch of stuff down a **river** in China and polluting it (so it turned yellow) or I see the Little Engine that Could flying across the sky making the Milky Way.;3) [[aspr8045](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aspr8045)] 2-2-2009(72): "I CAN has WATER?" sez **river** cat.;4) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 11-3-2008(44): With enough _water_ you _can_ make a **river**.;5) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 26-8-2008(24): The lesson of persistence: even drops of _water can_ become a **RIVER**.
泊;overnight;When you stop at an inn for an **overnight** rest, all you expect is a bit of _water_ for a wash and a set of clean _white_ sheets to wrap your weary bones in.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(171): Please supply a guest who stays **overnight** with WATER and WHITE sheets.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 27-8-2007(99): When I go to an **OVERNIGHT** party, all I need is a bit of **water** and some of that hard **white**. (crack). (not really, but come on. much easier to recall than white sheets).;3) [[peepiceek](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek)] 1-5-2008(54): **Overnight** water white (it rhymes).;4) [[Jared](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jared)] 11-2-2008(34): I asked the soaking wet white girl to stay **overnight**.;5) [[moojitsu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/moojitsu)] 19-10-2006(26): If you let your daughter's boyfriend stay **overnight** , expect white drops of water to be in unsettling places. (Sorry if this offends anyone.).
湖;lake;_Water_ . . . _old_ . . . _flesh_. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the _waters_ of a stormy **lake** because their _flesh_ had gotten too _old_ to bear the burdens of life.;;1) [[Shizuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru)] 2-8-2007(305): This is my favorite story. Simply associate the sad moment of an OLD person, standing near the WATER of the **lake** and looking at the MOON reflected in the **lake**. The created primitives themselves are put so beautifully, that you will not forget this kanji.;2) [[DBJ07](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DBJ07)] 17-2-2007(94): Water reflects the old moon in the **lake**.;3) [[I_pity_the_fool](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/I_pity_the_fool)] 21-5-2008(51): Water + old + flesh. Imagine a group of senior citizens skinnydipping in a nearby **lake**.;4) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 20-2-2008(38): Tip: Heisig later combines _old_ and _moon_ into 胡 [uncivilized](../v4/2470.html) (#2470 胡). Story: Drinking _water_ straight from the **lake** is rather _uncivilized_. (OR: _Uncivilized_ communities get their _water_ straight from the **lake**.;5) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 26-3-2008(23): Some **lake** s are used by criminals to dump _old_ _body parts_ in the _water_.
測;fathom;Connoting the measurement of the depth of _water_ , the keyword **fathom** begins with the _water_ primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for _rule_ (Frame 92) which we learned in the sense of a  "ruler" or "measure." Hence, when we _rule_ _water_ we **fathom** it. What could be simpler? But be careful, its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself **fathoming** a body of _water_ several hundred feet deep by using a _ruler_ of gargantuan proportions.;;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 11-1-2007(150): A _fathom_ is the unit you use when making **rules** about **water** 's depth.;2) [[XanthosDeia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/XanthosDeia)] 13-7-2008(76): You can't **fathom** how deep this _water_ is. Perhaps you should use a _ruler_ to measure it?;3) [[cornfed](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornfed)] 20-1-2008(28): Imagine jumping in the water and riding a shellfish down to the bottom, measuring **fathom** s with your ruler.;4) [[anroo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo)] 15-7-2009(20): **Fathom** s beneath the _water_ , a _shellfish_ defends the depths with his _sabre_.;5) [[gavmck](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gavmck)] 17-10-2009(17): HINT: I find 測 and 則 confusing. For 則 [rule](../v4/88.html) (#88 則)Heisig describes the keyword as a rule (regulation). Then in [fathom](../v4/149.html) (#149 測) he suggests 則 is a ruler or measure! Whatever stories you choose, don't loose sight of the meaning: 則 = rule (regulation, law), 測 = **fathom** (measure, conjecture).
土;soil;I don't like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of **soil** piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try.;* As a primitive, the sense of _soil_ is extended to that of _ground_ because of its connection with the kanji for the same (Frame 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of _dirt_ and _land_.;1) [[mparrett1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mparrett1)] 18-6-2006(87): Remembering **soil** is easy. If **soil** is soft, you can take a _walking stick_ and plunge it two* feet into the ground.;2) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 11-3-2008(32): The grave was marked by a cross sticking out of the **soil**.;3) [[Gendal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Gendal)] 9-2-2009(24): **Soil** is neither positive nor negative.;4) [[skeeter3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skeeter3)] 15-8-2007(19): King Arthur pulled the magical sword Excalibur out of the hardened **soil** to claim his place as king.;5) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 27-11-2008(7): I tried to stick a _needle_ in the _ground_ but it wouldn't go through the hard **SOIL**.
吐;spit;We have here a rather small _mouth_ (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of _dirt_. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a _mouth_ full of _dirt_. As least I know what I would do: **spit** it out as fast and far as I could!;;1) [[zoletype](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zoletype)] 8-4-2008(123): **SPIT** goes from my MOUTH to the GROUND.;2) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 30-7-2007(69): The only things that come out of my MOUTH and onto the GROUND are **spit** and vomit. Everything else (words, song) floats on the air.;3) [[twincy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/twincy)] 20-6-2007(27): Means _vomit_ as well. a more decent way to say what you thow up could be " _mouth_ _soil_ ".;4) [[Josh_Teperman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Josh_Teperman)] 9-1-2009(23): When you get _dirt_ in your _mouth_ , you have to **spit** it out.;5) [[smujohnson](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson)] 27-8-2008(10): Usually when people **SPIT** , it's because something is LEFT IN THEIR MOUTH … In that case, they just **spit** it out.. RIGHT on the GROUND!
圧;pressure;One of the things that causes the erosion of _soil_ is the excessive **pressure** of the top _soil_ on the lower _soil_. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep _cliff_ without a tree in sight. The **slightest** pressure on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(212): The GROUND at the base of a CLIFF must suffer from enormous **pressure**.;2) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 4-8-2007(52): For physics people: p = F/A (p:pressure, F:Force, A:Area). Where the force is from the immensity of the cliff. The area on the cliff is covered by soil. So the equation becomes p = F/A = cliff/soil which preserves the position of the primitives.;3) [[stereovibe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stereovibe)] 11-3-2008(38): The _cliff_ exerts a lot of **pressure** on the _ground_ beneath it.;4) [[rasteps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rasteps)] 1-10-2006(24): The taller the _cliff_ , the more **pressure** on the _soil_ below it.;5) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 26-8-2008(10): Be careful of landslides! The _soil_ under the _cliff_ is under enormous **PRESSURE**.
埼;cape;The **cape** pictured here is a jut of _land_ like **Cape** Cod. The _soil_ on the left tells us we have to do with _land_ , and the _strange_ on the right tells us it is a **_cape_** where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of **Cape** _Strange_ (or, if you prefer, **Cape** _Odd_ ).;;1) [[frychiko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko)] 3-7-2008(160): This refers to LAND, not the STRANGE gear superheroes wear.;2) [[usis35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35)] 27-5-2007(77): **Cape** Cod "odd" is a land where odd=strange things happen.;3) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 18-1-2009(57): A **CAPE** is a piece of LAND that stands out STRANGLY in the sea.;4) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 4-8-2007(43): It's quite strange. When I go to **Cape** Odd, I always end up soiling myself!;5) [[thegreatkaizo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegreatkaizo)] 19-7-2008(20): What the hell does the NASA do at **Cape** Canaveral? The _soil_ there looks kinda _strange_ …
垣;hedge;The **hedge** depicted in this frame is the miraculous **hedge** of briar roses that completely _spanned_ the castle _grounds_ in which Sleeping Beauty lay for a hundred years, so that none but her predestined beloved could find his way through it.;;1) [[Wahlin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wahlin)] 29-8-2006(134): Before the Great Wall of China, there was a dirt **hedge** that spanned across.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 20-12-2007(76): The **HEDGE** of roses growing from the castle _grounds_ fully _spanned_ the castle walls.;3) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 10-3-2008(50): The **HEDGE** spans the **GROUNDS** of the estate.;4) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 5-9-2007(23): The entire grounds were spanned by a **hedge**.;5) [[eri401](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401)] 31-12-2009(18): The kanji also means a fence. Think of a dirt wall that spans your property. 石垣 = いしがき = stone wall.
填;inlay;When we hear the world **inlay** , we usually think of setting precious stones in pieces of jewelery, but the primitive elements here suggest _truth_ being **inlaid** in the _soil_. You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that **inlaid** the _truth_ of the universe in the stuff of the earth.;;1) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 9-4-2007(63): In a hole in the _ground_ , the body of the victim was placed. And then the killer **stuffed it up** so that the _truth_ would not be found out, he hoped.;2) [[Ragnarocko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ragnarocko)] 22-7-2008(26): I stuffed up his mouth with dirt to keep the truth from coming out.;3) [[Corodon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Corodon)] 11-7-2009(16): There is no _ground_ s for what you are saying. It's not _true_. You're just making **stuff up**. I ought to **stuff up** your mouth to make you STFU.;4) [[kanjihito](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito)] 12-11-2012(11): The _ground_ appeared **stuffed up** with with random deposits, or was it **inlaid** with the _truth_ of the universe?;5) [[oregum](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oregum)] 6-11-2011(9): I STUFFED DIRT into his mouth to keep the TRUTH from coming to out.
圭;squared jewel;Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, **square jewel** , depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of _soil_ on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays.;* As a primitive, we shall use this character to mean _ivy_ , that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the _ground_ to form a sort of  "second" _ground_ that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping.;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 9-10-2005(166): Piling _SOIL_ upon _SOIL_ for aeons is how **SQUARE JEWEL** S are formed deep in the earth.;2) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 14-4-2008(62): How would you stop someone stealing your biggest **square jewel**? Bury it deep in the _soil_ under _ground_. Then plant _ivy_ to mark the spot.;3) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 3-2-2008(27): Layering _soil_ over _soil_ can create many things, from precious **SQUARE JEWEL** S to lush beds of _ivy_.;4) [[nesert](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert)] 3-10-2009(21): The pirate wanted to hide his **square jewel** well. So, he buried it in the _soil_ , under the _ground_ and planted poison _ivy_ over the spot.;5) [[keizai](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/keizai)] 4-11-2009(10): Soil upon Soil compressed to make Diamond **Square Jewel** s.
封;seal;Think of the key word **seal** as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax **seal** , you _glue_ a sprig of _ivy_ on the outside. In this way the elements _ivy_ and _glue_ give you a curious and memorable way to **seal** your secret letters.;;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 11-1-2006(128): The king used a special **seal** of ivy leaves glued onto his document.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 12-12-2007(64): A bit of _ivy_ _glued_ to a letter can make a lovely **SEAL** when in a pinch, says Martha Stewart.;3) [[tatsuya](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tatsuya)] 20-10-2008(62): _Squared jewels_ with the right _measure_ ments receive the jeweler's **seal** of approval.;4) [[mafried](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mafried)] 26-2-2007(44): Be careful with the order. FIRST you wrap it up in _ivy_ , THEN you **seal** it with _glue_.;5) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 15-3-2011(20): Think of an old book of magic, **seal** ed to prevent it from harming the uninitiated. The **seal** ing spell is contained in a _square jewel_ which is _glue_ d to the cover. The cover of the book possibly also has an _ivy_ motif embossed in the cracked leather. 封 ふう sea, 封筒 ふうとう envelope, 封切る ふうぎる release a film, 封建 ほうけん feudalistic.
涯;horizon;After seeing a constant **horizon** of _water_ , _water_ everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the _ivy_ -clad _cliffs_ of land on a new **horizon**? Of course, you'd need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact _ivy_ , but the phrase " _ivy_ -clad _cliffs_ " has such a nice ring to it that we won't worry about such details.;;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 10-9-2007(230): Try to reverse Heisig's story in this Kanji: imagine being trapped in one of those prison towers on an ivy cladcliff like in the movies. From your prison ontop the ivy clad cliff all you can see in the distant **horizon** is nothing but water.;2) [[jljzen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jljzen)] 3-1-2009(72): From the water, I can see the ivy-clad-cliffs on the **horizon**.;3) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 8-5-2008(39): Over the WATER and past the **HORIZON** there is said to be a CLIFF that holds a very rare JEWEL.;4) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 14-4-2008(17): Across the _water_ , I can see _ivy_ covered _cliffs_ on the **horizon**.;5) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 23-3-2007(11): Since Hesig doesn't have another Kanji with the keyword of "shore" it might be worth pointing out to folks here that this is the alternate meaning for this kanji asides from **horizon**. Also meshes well with Hesig's story spotting those Ivy clad Cliffs on the **horizon**. Spotting green and beautiful shore- land off in the distance across the water!!
寺;Buddhist temple;You have heard of people "attaching" themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a **Buddhist temple** with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused _land_ around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with _glue_ , steps down firmly, and so joins the **Buddhist temple** as a  "permanent member.";;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(179): At the **Buddhist temple** the monks are seated on the _ground_ , _glued_ there in meditation.;2) [[Murjab](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab)] 2-9-2007(45): To be allowed to join the **Buddhist temple** , imagine an aspiring monk being asked to stand still in the _soil_ for a long time in a _measurement_ of his resolve.;3) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 3-2-2008(21): How long a **BUDDHIST TEMPLE** has stood on its _grounds_ is often a _measure_ of its worth.;4) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 12-9-2007(12): The Buddhist in the temple sit on the _ground_ for years contemplating life, the universe, and everything. Not because they want to but because someone switched the floor wax with _superglue_.;5) [[hornlo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo)] 12-5-2011(7): [ **Buddhist temple** = _soil_ / _glue_ ] - in a **Buddhist temple** , you can free yourself of the _earth_ that _glues_ you to this world.
時;time;"What is **time**? " asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. "Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you." Here we have the kanji's answer to that perennial riddle. **Time** is a _sun_ rising over a _Buddhist temple_. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character.;;1) [[zdnks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zdnks)] 31-10-2007(120): When the SUN starts to shine on the TEMPLE, it's **time** to get up.;2) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 27-2-2008(102): In ancient Japan, **TIME** of ''day'' was announced at the ''buddhist temples''. They did this by ringing large iron bells. This is similar to churches who ring their bells to announce the **time** of day.;3) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 26-8-2008(45): A _day_ at a _Buddhist temple_ is **TIME** well spent.;4) [[Tatiana](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tatiana)] 19-10-2006(21): You will fully understand the concept of **time** if you spend a _day_ in a _Buddhist temple_.;5) [[raye505](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raye505)] 5-6-2009(9): **Time** is marked by the sun at buddhist temples.
均;level;The **level** this key word refers to is not the carpenter's tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures _soil_ being scooped up into a _ladle_ and then made **level** (apparently because one is measuring _soil_ ). The excess _drops of soil_ are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added _drop_ at the _ladle's_ edge.;;1) [[dshill99](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dshill99)] 4-2-2008(268): _Soil_ is scooped up into a _ladel_. The extra _drop_ is brushed off to make it **level**.;2) [[mafried](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mafried)] 6-4-2009(49): To remember the extra stroke in the ladle, make a vivid image of a big drop of excess soil fr0m the ladle falling out onto the ground when you **level** it.;3) [[trebors](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trebors)] 28-7-2010(41): 匀 = equal, not ladle 勺 = ladle. > so the story would be equal soil is equal to **level** ed ground.;4) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 12-12-2007(25): Kids like scooping _dirt_ with plastic _ladles_ when making mud pies and often sweep off the extra _bits of dirt_ to get it exactly **LEVEL**.;5) [[Aerithina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerithina)] 21-11-2008(7): Per LIVELLARE il SUOLO, prendi il MESTOLO e rimuovi quel BRICIOLO/GOCCIA di terreno in piú.
火;fire;Just as sitting before a **fire** enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of **fire** you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form - first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.;* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a _fireplace_ (or _hearth_ ) or a raging _conflagration_ like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning. Another primitive element for _fire_ , based on this one, is written as 4 small drops and will mean _flames_ , _cauldron_ , _cooking fire_ , or an _oven fire_.;1) [[munia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/munia)] 22-2-2008(57): For some reason, this kanji reminds me of a person running, her arms (the two drops) raised up, because she caught on **fire**!;2) [[raseru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raseru)] 16-6-2008(29): A tepee getting shot at by **fire** arrows.;3) [[mistamark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark)] 3-9-2008(23): To be honest, it just looks like the flames of a **fire** to me.;4) [[LoneDeranger](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LoneDeranger)] 7-2-2009(11): Looks like a flame of a campfire with two _drops of_ sparks flying off.;5) [[ryowarrior18](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ryowarrior18)] 16-8-2009(8): A **FIRE** bender from Avatar, wielding flames in both hands.
炎;inflammation;A _fire_ belongs IN the _hearth_ , not OVER it. When the _fire_ spreads to the rest of the house, we have an **inflamed** house. And as with any **inflammation**  \- including those that attack our bodies - the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of element for _fire_ , one atop the other.;;1) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 28-2-2008(176): To fight **fire** with **fire** would just **inflame** a situation.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(52): An **inflammation** can often feel like FIRE upon FIRE burning.;3) [[TerryS](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TerryS)] 27-11-2008(32): If you have an **INFLAMMATION** , it feels like there's _fire_ above and below your skin.;4) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 5-8-2007(15): "Inflammable means flammable? What a country!" - from the Simpsons. Saying both flammable and inflammable helps you remember that there are two fires. **Inflammation** and inflammable have almost the same spelling.;5) [[ninalaura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ninalaura)] 1-11-2009(13): When you suffer from a bad **inflammation** , i.e. an infection, your body will fight it with a high fever. So it fights _fire_ with _fire_.
煩;anxiety;The existential condition of **anxiety** that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character. The _head_ is set _afire_ , causing deep torment of spirit (and a whopper of a headache).;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(173): An **anxiety** feels like FIRE in the HEAD.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 9-10-2007(96): Imagine the **anxiety** a librarian would feel if the library caught _fire_ and all the _pages_ of his books were burning up.;3) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 21-12-2005(70): Many performers get "Michael Jackson **anxiety** " wherein they fear their head will catch on fire.;4) [[PrettyKitty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PrettyKitty)] 4-7-2007(22): In ancient times, they said **anxiety** was cause by "fire in the head." Picture doctors prescibing many different crazy/silly ways to get the fire out of the patient's head. Now picture it like your watching a documentary on the History Channel about it. Not going to forget it anytime soon now. :).;5) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 5-11-2008(12): I would be feeling **anxiety** too if there was a _fire_ on my _head_!
淡;thin;The primitives in this kanji read: _water_ . . . _inflammation_. Taking _inflammation_ in its medical sense, the first _water_ -related _inflammation_ that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very **thin**. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very **thin** chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being _inflamed_ with) dehydration (hence the element for _water_ ).;;1) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 11-10-2006(328): Drink _water_ and _burn twice_ as many calories as you eat… you'll definitely get **thin**. Imagine inside your body, all those calories literally being _burned_ from above and below… THAT's what it takes to become **thin**.;2) [[mezbup](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mezbup)] 5-11-2008(182): **Thin** girls are twice as hot when they're wet.;3) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 29-9-2007(35): To become **thin** , simply go into a sauna. It may be as hot as a _conflagration_ , but you'll sweat ( _water_ ) and lose 10 pounds.;4) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 31-7-2008(32): Adding _water_ to an _inflammation_ sure will make it a **thin** _fire_.;5) [[xingji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xingji)] 24-4-2008(25): Water + Fire over fire Faint, pale, fleeting, dim. (NOT **THIN**!) I remember it using its kun yomi : awa(i), because i see volcanic islands with water around. Yes Hawaii… (the kanji key whose keyword is dilute actually means **thin** ).
灯;lamp;Since it is very hard to read by the _fireplace_ without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to _nail_ down a bit of that _fire_ , just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The **lamp**.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 3-9-2007(202): Imagine old gas **lamp** s which had a _flame_ to light up the _street signs_.;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(85): A **lamp** is _fire_ you can hang from a _nail_.;3) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 21-4-2008(21): When this symbol was created, a **lamp** was simply a _fire_ at the side of the _street_.;4) [[Evangelo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Evangelo)] 20-8-2008(19): _Warning: This story is graphic._ In Rome, after the Third Servile War, the losing rebels were crucified (on T shaped crosses) and set _on fire_ along the _road_ back to Rome. These human **lamp** s lit up the massive _road_ with burning corpses as a reminder not to lose against the Romans. Thanks Latin 3!;5) [[ACGalaga](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ACGalaga)] 5-2-2010(9): A long time ago they used _fire_ for _street_ **lamp** s.
畑;farm;Looking at the primitives, a _fireplace_ and a _rice field_ , we find the essential ingredients for a **farm** : a warm _hearth_ to sit by at night, and a well-plowed _field_ to grow one's crops in by day.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(245): Many **farm** s are created by first setting FIRE over the land to clear the land for the FIELDS.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 16-7-2007(49): When creating a **farm** , the prospective **farm** er must first set _fire_ to the forest to clear the ground. Only then can he plow the _fields_. _Fire_ before _fields_ to make a **farm**.;3) [[kashikoi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kashikoi)] 9-1-2009(45): This kanji actually makes a boatload of sense. In Japan, rice **farm** ers are constantly making little fires on their rice **farm** s burning up all the old stalks and things probably to be used as fertilizer. In moving to Japan, I found this practice to be very new and odd to me. So I would venture to guess that's exactly where this kanji comes from. If not, it certainly makes it really easy to remember.;4) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 5-10-2008(14): Crap! the _field_ in our neighbour's **farm** is on _fire_!;5) [[johngwk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk)] 23-6-2010(5): On a Japanese **farm** , _fire_ is often set to the _rice_ fields (after harvest).
災;disaster;Of all of nature's **disasters** , this kanji picks out two of the worst: _floods_ and _fires_. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature's solution to nature's own problem: a great _flood_ pouring down over a great forest _fire_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(178): What a **disaster**! First a FIRE, then on top of it came FLOODs.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 2-5-2007(28): Don't know about Japan, but here in Australia, flooding rivers and bushfires are the most common natural **disaster** s.;3) [[colonel32](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/colonel32)] 20-1-2007(26): Godzilla pissing a _stream_ of _fire_ all over Tokyo. That is a **disaster**!;4) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 29-2-2008(17): _C_ -autioun- _C_ -aution- _C_ -aution: because of the _fire_ this is now a **disaster** area.;5) [[Marshall3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Marshall3)] 21-8-2009(12): There's a flood upstairs, and a fire in the basement. I think it's safe to say that this is a **disaster**.
灰;ashes;The kanji for **ashes** naturally includes the primitive for _fire_ , or more specifically, a _fireplace_. Now what do you do with that bucket of **ashes** you have just cleaned out of the _fireplace_? You walk to the edge of a _cliff_ and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the _fire_ , once it has turned to **ashes** , ends up at the bottom of the _cliff_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(125): The _fire_ underneath the _cliff_ will eventually turn everything above to **ashes**.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 2-2-2008(83): After the cremation _fire_ , many prefer to scatter their loved-one's **ASHES** from seaside _cliffs_.;3) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 9-8-2007(57): Scene from "The Big Lebowski" : Walter scatters Donny's **ashes** , but a wind blows much of the **ashes** into "The Dude" Lebowski's face. Upset, The Dude lashes out at Walter. Walter apologizes and hugs The Dude, before suggesting "Fuck it, man. Let's go bowling." I bet you that The Dude wanted to cremate ( _fire_ ) Walter right there and then, at the top of the _cliff_! (thanks Elktapestry).;4) [[kirihitokiri](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kirihitokiri)] 9-3-2008(21): After _fire_ erupts from under the _cliff_ s (volcano) everything is covered in **ashes**. Thnx khooks!;5) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 13-6-2006(11): After fire erupts from the ground (volcano) the cliffs will be covered in **ashes**.
点;spot;If you look into the flickering of a _fire_ for a long time and then turn aside, you will see **spots** before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before - as least as far as know, they didn't - imagine using those **spots** as a technique for _fortune-telling_. The old witch sits before her _cauldron_ and watches the **spots** that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that _tells your fortune_. Think of it as a kind of **spot** -check on your future.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(226): The FORTUNE TELLER was burned by FLAMES on the **spot** because she was accused of being a witch.;2) [[etpan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan)] 12-6-2008(138): You have to stimulate the G-spot with your _magic wand_ in order to get her on _fire_. Or you can juste use your _mouth_ …;3) [[noushina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noushina)] 23-11-2012(33): The _Fortune Teller_ stares into an _Campfire_ until she sees **SPOTS**. She then interprets those **spot** s in the same manner than another fortune teller would look at tea leaves or the bumps on your head.;4) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 2-3-2008(14): Alternate meaning of the kanji is **mark** , or **points**. Like japanese tests are graded from 0 to 100 depending on how many **percent** of the questions they got correct. Before I learned any alternate meaning to this I took it as **percentage** = statistics. Now, wouldn't some pure and concrete **statistics** be just the thing you need to set that _fortune tellers_ mind on _fire_? Relate the setting him/her on fire to the entry for [anxiety](../v4/163.html) (#163 煩) if it helps. :).;5) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 29-3-2008(10): "Out damn **spot**!" Yelled the crazy _fortune teller_ as she leaped into the _fire_. I guess thats not quite how it happened in Hamlet though, so I got a low **mark** on my English test.
照;illuminate;Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for **illuminate** can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something _shine_. If you glaze a pot and put it into the _oven_ to _fire_ it, you in fact _illuminate_ it. Hence the kanji for **illuminate** compares the kanji for _shining_ with the primitive element for the _oven's fire_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 27-7-2007(276): SHINING FLAMES **illuminate**!;2) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 16-9-2007(91): The sun was seduced to give us fire, by which we **illuminate** the night.;3) [[rotifera](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rotifera)] 16-11-2007(43): Just _shining_ is not enough to **illuminate**. The shiny thing needs to be even brighter. Maybe set it on _fire_?;4) [[wzafran](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran)] 2-6-2007(27): You find yourself trapped in an unfamiliar cavern, engulfed in darkness. You wield a Rod of Light with your right hand, its tip is _shining_ , but faintly. Thence, with your other hand, you cast a spell and set _fire_ to the rod. And this rod, which shines with much greater fervour than before, is what would **illuminate** a path before you, that you then follow until you reach the outer caverns.;5) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 28-3-2008(23): The man who shines shoes in the day stands alone at night in the cold, dark city. He keeps himself warm in front of a burning trash barrel, his face **illuminated** by the flames.
魚;fish;The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: _bound up_ . . . _rice field_ . . . _cooking fire_. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a **fish** is caught and _bound up_ on a line with its unfortunate school-mates, when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the _rice fields_ for fertilizer, and the rest he sets in a skillet over a _cooking fire_ for his supper.;;1) [[silkcherryblossoms](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/silkcherryblossoms)] 10-6-2007(106): The elements of this kanji are bound up, rice field and cooking fire. When I think of bound up cooked rice, it makes me think of sushi, which in turn brings to mind **fish**.;2) [[tomusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan)] 12-2-2008(56): _Bind_ that **FISH** and _cook_ his _brains_! Yarhh!;3) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(42): That **fish** was caught, BOUND UP, then carried across RICE FIELDS, and finally cooked over an OVEN FIRE.;4) [[DavidZ](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DavidZ)] 20-9-2010(18): Think of (cooked) salmon onigiri. The **fish** is _bound up_ in _rice_ and cooked over a _fire_ … 魚 [さかな] [、金魚](midori://search?text=、金魚) [きんぎょ] [、魚市場](midori://search?text=、魚市場) [おういちば].;5) [[Keiran_Halcyon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Keiran_Halcyon)] 9-7-2009(9): I like my **fish** _bound_ with _rice_ over a nice _fire_. Sushi!!
漁;fishing;To the story we have just made about _fish_ , this kanji for the profession of **fishing** adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the _water_ , where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the _water_  when you put it all together.;;1) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 5-3-2008(125): You need WATER and FISH for **fishing**.;2) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 1-5-2006(37): If you are confusing this with angling like me, take **fishing** to mean not the act of catching a _fish_ but the act of being a _fish_ not living but **fishing** (i.e. in the _water_ ).;3) [[FuDaWei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FuDaWei)] 18-5-2010(17): "FISHING For Idiots", Chapter One: _Fish_ are generally found in _water_.;4) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 2-3-2008(15): What? The _fish_ 's still in the _water_? Well, you better go **fishing** then!;5) [[bspitz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bspitz)] 9-2-2010(10): **Fishing** is taking _fish_ out of _water_.
里;ri;That's right - a **_ri_**. Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary, it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One **_ri_** is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the _rice field_ , and below the element for _land_. Those four sections you see in the _rice field_ (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of _land_ , much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a "country mile." The _land_ division based on the size of a _rice field_ is called a **_ri_**.;* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a _computer_ , a meaning deriving from the kanji for _logic_ , which we will meet in Lesson 12.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(141): The **ri** is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a **RI** CE FIELD.;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(86): Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You'll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: **House of the Parents**.;3) [[Bullfrog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullfrog)] 15-4-2008(49): It's not just any computer. It's an old Ata **ri**.;4) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 27-2-2011(35): My **parents' house** is on a _rice field_ , I _compute_ the _ground_ area being one **ri** by one **ri**. 古里 (ふるさと) : home town, birthplace, old village, historic village, native place, one's old home, 郷里 (きょうり) : birth- place, home town.;5) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 1-2-2009(33): It frustrates me that Hesig doesn't give any mention to another prominent meaning of the 里 / **Ri** Kanji being used for さと meaning a country village or home. perhaps he thought it would be too confusing for one to remember two different types of villages and distinguish this from 町 … however… If I think of that one as まち and this one as さと it keeps things straight in my head and allows me to skip the whole confusing path of thinking of this as a "computer" which just seems somewhat wrong.
黒;black;Like most things electrical, a _computer_ , too, can overheat. Just imagine _flames_ pouring out of it and charring the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty **black** color.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(102): If you burn the GROUND of a RICE FIELD with FIRE, eventually it will turn **black**.;2) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 21-3-2008(37): If your _parent's home_ catches on _fire_ , it will turn **black**.;3) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 25-3-2007(12): Computer-shomputer… this is a さと（ 里 ）being ravaged by fire… down into charred and burnt **black** ened remains!;4) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 12-7-2006(12): Rice field … soil … fire. **Black** volcanic soil is perfect for growing rice. It is only logical that farmers regularly burn the brush on their fields in an attempt to imitate nature.;5) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 27-8-2008(11): _Burning_ a _computer_ is _ri_ -diculous. It just leaves everything all **BLACK**.
墨;black ink;Besides meaning **black ink** , this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the _dirt_ with _black_ lines for a foot ballgame (played, I presume, on a white field).;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 1-8-2007(157): Theres BLACK on the GROUND…most likely someone spilt some **black ink**.;2) [[oliviergirard](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oliviergirard)] 1-2-2007(70): Anyone who has worked with laserjet ink cartridges will know the **black ink** looks like powdered dirt.;3) [[sprutnik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik)] 17-10-2008(63): **Black ink** comes from _black_ _soil_.;4) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 25-3-2007(21): Charred bamboo is an essential ingredient in certain types of sumi ink. Imagine that the old さと that burnt down was composed primarily of bamboo houses and structures… thus, residents of the new さと often return to those old grounds to scoop up the charred remains from the soil in order to make thier **black ink**.;5) [[lifeflaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw)] 1-12-2008(10): Before mixing with a liquid, **black ink** looks like _black_ _soil_!
鯉;carp;These are the same **carp** you see in Japanese  " **carp** streamers. " Only here we find a small home _computer_ or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a **carp** swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a _computer_. Ugh.;;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 29-9-2007(224): Japanese **carp** are massive _fish_ \- they are measured in _ri_!;2) [[colonel32](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/colonel32)] 11-10-2006(133): Robo **carp**!!! Part _fish_ , part _computer_! Visualise him flapping and clanking down the street, with bullets richoting off his scaly armour.;3) [[Branduil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Branduil)] 3-3-2006(79): The fish got **carp** al tunnel syndrome from the computer(I know it's lame but it's hard to find a good story for this).;4) [[gringozolano](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gringozolano)] 5-4-2008(31): In front of my **parents' home** is a **fish** pond full of _carp_.;5) [[alanj](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alanj)] 7-9-2008(27): Bad pun: Japanese **carp** are _fish_ that grow RI-ly big! :-).
量;quantity;Think of **quantity** as having to do with measuring time and distance, and the rest is simple: you have a quantity of time in the new day that begins with _nightbreak_ , and a quantity of distance in the rural _ri_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(275): I did such a **quantity** of work that when NIGHT BREAK came, I was asleep on the COMPUTER.;2) [[Murjab](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab)] 7-9-2007(84): If you find that by _nightbreak_ , you're still playing at your _computer_ , chances are your World of Warcraft character has a high **quantity** of levels. [thanks to ssmoler] ….. To remember that _nightbreak_ appears ABOVE _computer_ , think of looking UP from your computer at the window to realize you've been playing until nightbreak.;3) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 21-7-2006(72): A **quantity** can be a measure of time or space (day/ri).;4) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 29-3-2008(57): I have such a huge **quantity** of kanji to review that _night break_ usually finds me in front of my _computer_ reviewing the kanji.;5) [[slivir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/slivir)] 19-10-2009(22): At _nightbreak_ , it's logical to check the **quantity** of porn you downloaded to your _computer_ overnight.
厘;rin;No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One **_rin_** is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen - or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something  "very, very tiny." The kanji shows a _cliff_ with a _computer_ under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home _computer_ that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one **_rin_**!;;1) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 26-3-2008(198): I threw my **Rin** dows _computer_ off a _cliff_ because it kept crashing. Now, after its last crash, it's worth less than a **rin**.;2) [[tomusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan)] 16-2-2008(76): A _computer_ dropped off of a _cliff_ would be worth about 1 **RIN**.;3) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 7-4-2008(50): The Square Root of 1 RI = 1 **RIN**.;4) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 12-7-2007(33): He dropped his _computer_ from the top of the _cliff_ and it turned to smithe- **rin** -s.;5) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 26-3-2007(25): Looking down at the 里 from the high cliff above such a tiny country village looks even smaller like something very very tiny and insignificant… Like a りん / **Rin**. Also might be worth-while to note now that this isn't just 1/10th of a 銭 but also 1/10th of a 分 or rather… 0.3mm in length. Perhaps imagine holding up a ruler from that high up to measure the tiny speck of a 里 below and note it coming out to 0.3mm in length. [ずっとずっと小さいですね～](midori://search?text=ずっとずっと小さいですね～) !!
埋;bury;When we speak of **burying** something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under _ground_. Only here, we are **burying** our beloved _computer_ that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the  "Dies irae, dies illa" and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little _dirt_ into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P.;;1) [[Rowan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rowan)] 21-9-2007(120): You can't **bury** computers underground, because of the dangerous heavy metals, so you hide them behind an equally large mound of soil and hope no-one notices.;2) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 5-3-2008(80): I used SOIL to **BURY** my COMPUTER.;3) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 3-1-2011(60): **Bury** me in the _soil_ beside my _parents' house_. That's where I want to be laid to rest. 埋め込む (うめこむ) : to **bury** , 埋蔵 (まいぞう) : buried property, treasure trove.;4) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 19-12-2007(31): If you assigned the meaning "House of the Fathers" to [ri](../v4/173.html) (#173 里), this one becomes a lot easier. When I die, I want to be **buried** in these _grounds_ so that my body can find rest at the _House of my fathers_.;5) [[dhalprin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dhalprin)] 24-5-2010(18): When I die, **bury** me in the soil - next to my computer.
同;same;The primitives in this kanji show us _one_ and _mouth_ under a _hood_. Let us take the key word to connote the **sameness** that characterizes the life in community of the monk. They all have the **same** habits, including the "habit" they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk's _cowl_ , drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a _mouth_. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a short step to think of _one mouth_ under a _hood_ as the kanji for the **sameness** of monastic life.;* As a primitive, this will mean _monks_ dressed in a common habit.;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(215): Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the **same** , you can just see ONE MOUTH and very little else.;2) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 5-9-2007(84): Imagine monks wandering around the monastery. Covered in their _hoods_ and chanting as if with _one mouth_ they all look the **same** !;3) [[mdspencer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mdspencer)] 8-5-2008(52): _One_ _mouth_ under a _hood_ looks the **same** as any other.;4) [[joxn_costello](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello)] 17-11-2008(14): The cylon warriors all look the **same** : their _helmet_ with their _one_ glowing eye and their fixed _mouth_. (Now I can use "cylon" as an alternate keyword for this kanji!).;5) [[romilmittal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romilmittal)] 4-2-2009(7): Muslim women wearing veils (HOOD) all look the **same** , you can just see ONE MOUTH and a thin eye line.
洞;den;The key word **den** refers to an animal lair hollowed out in the side of a mountain. Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for _same_ , we can picture a **den** of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of _water_ we need only give them a sacred  "puddle" in the center of their **den** , the focus of all their pious attentions.;;1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 12-7-2007(297): All the animals in the **den** share the _same_ _water_.;2) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 13-1-2011(38): " **Den** " and " **cave** " also make me think of a _monk_ 's cell. Monks take vows of silence and fast. So a **den** is where you'd find nothing but _water_ (to drink) and a _monk_. 洞 ほら cave, **den** , grotto, 洞窟 どうくつ cave, 洞察 どうさつ discernment, insight.;3) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 16-7-2009(35): Animals always build their **den** in the _same_ place - beside the _water_.;4) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 8-4-2008(21): All those **caves** were formed by _water_ , and… they all look exactly the _same_ to me!;5) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 25-2-2009(16): There's a secret **den** in the monastery where some of the _monks_ hold _water_ -pistol fights.
胴;trunk;The word **trunk** refers to the _part of the body_ that is left when you have " **truncated** " all the limbs. I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the _same_ so they could be floated downstream without causing a _body_ -jam.;;1) [[scottamus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/scottamus)] 16-11-2005(186): A **trunk** , a **trunk** // The _body_ of a _monk_ // The body of a monk in a **trunk** , a **trunk**.;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 2-10-2007(157): Dead _flesh_ all looks the _same_ when you chop off everything but the **trunk**. Yes, I'm appalled at how gruesome this story is too.;3) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 13-10-2008(80): The **trunk** (torso) of everyone's _body_ is mostly the _same_.;4) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 12-3-2008(41): Under the **MOON** the kinky **MONKS** bare their **TRUNKS**.;5) [[jHerbin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jHerbin)] 25-3-2010(30): Your **trunk** (torso) is where the _body parts_ meet at the _same place_.
向;yonder;Something referred to as "over **yonder** " is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight - like a wee _drop_ in the distance - and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out. Hence this kanji begins with a _drop_. Then we find a sort of transparent _helmet_ with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent _mouth_ under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its _mouth_ open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over **yonder** with its fuel tank on empty.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 5-9-2007(142): Look over **yonder** ! That tiny _dot_ is robin _hood_ at the _mouth_ of his secret cave !;2) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 22-3-2008(73): There was an old woman named Wanda,// Who wanted to make herself blonder.// She covered her _くち_ // With a _glass hood_ from Gucci// And _drop_ ped some hair dye on from **yonder**.;3) [[Ceryn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ceryn)] 22-1-2008(63): The spaceman died screaming, his _MOUTH_ wide open because someone has cut the oxygen cable from the _HOOD/HELMET_ of his space suit. As his last _DROPs_ of oxygen escaped into the vastness of space he thought to himself, So much for flying off into the wild blue _YONDER_.;4) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 10-9-2007(38): Over **yonder** usually refers to somewhere far away. For this kanji think of the aliens way over **yonder** who have an antenna popping out of their helmet which encloses but a single mouth.;5) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 19-2-2007(30): **Yonder** ….there is a _DOT_ of light over the _mouth_ of the _cave_.
尚;esteem;Above we see the primitive for _little_ attached to one of those _glass canopies_ you might use to display a family heirloom. The _littleness_ is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted _mouth_ of an **esteemed** ancestor. We may be used to **esteeming** the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also **esteem** the very _mouth_ that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece.;;1) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 14-10-2007(242): An especially **esteem** ed alien has three antennae on his helmet.;2) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 17-1-2007(114): Remember that scene from Star Wars, where Luke is wearing that _helmet_ that only his _mouth_ could see, and was swinging at that _little_ thing buzzing around the room? That was Obi-Wan's trick to get Luke to build his self- **esteem** , or his confidence in the Force.;3) [[martinirwin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/martinirwin)] 4-12-2007(102): Little self-esteem is the signature of mouthy teenagers wearing hoodies.;4) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 25-9-2008(89): I have _little_ self-esteem.. so I keep my face under a _hood_ and my _mouth_ shut.;5) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 27-9-2007(24): I have a _small glass box_ with a _mouth_ inside. I hold this in great **esteem** , for it is the mouth of my ex and I did the world a great favor by stripping her of it.
字;character;Here is the character for **character** itself. Not just kanji, but any written **character** from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a _child_ in a _house_. But let us take advantage of the double-meaning of the key word to note that just as a _child_ born to a Japanese _house_ is given **characters** for its name, so it is also stamped with the **character** of those who raise it from infancy on.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(110): CHILDren learn Kanji **character** s underneath a HOUSE.;2) [[komodo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo)] 22-6-2008(82): "Why do I have to wear this roof on my head all the time father?" "Shut up! It builds **character**!".;3) [[axelb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb)] 19-3-2008(53): The first kanji **character** s you will learn in Japan is probably learnt at home (in the _house_ of your family) when you are still a _child_. Imagine a really small preschool child doing this (to prevent confusing house with school like in [study](../v4/324.html) (#324 学)).;4) [[harusame](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame)] 30-4-2009(22): The way a child grows up in his house determines his **character**.;5) [[applesuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki)] 15-2-2006(19): Imagine a child in his home (under the roof) sitting at the kitchen table practicing his kanji **character** s.
守;guard;The notion of **guarding** something easily brings to mind the image of someone standing **guard** , like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope's Swiss **Guard**. The whole idea of hiring **guards** is that they should stick like _glue_ to your _house_ to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and _glue_ a **guard** to your _house_ in imagination.;;1) [[certain](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/certain)] 5-4-2006(173): A **GUARD** is usually "glued" to the house he watches.;2) [[rakutenka](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rakutenka)] 2-7-2007(65): A **guard** provides a _measure_ of security to those under a _roof_.;3) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 16-12-2007(37): A good **GUARD** should stick to your _house_ like _glue_ and be willing to take any _measures_ to protect you.;4) [[strobrod](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/strobrod)] 5-4-2009(12): A good **guard** never leaves the _house_ he watches over. He's practically _glued_ to it.;5) [[jshield1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jshield1)] 21-4-2009(6): A **guard** gives those under a roof a measure of security.
完;perfect;In order not to confuse the key word **perfect** with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. _Per- factum_ suggests something so  "thoroughly made or done" that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a _house_ that has been made **perfectly** from its _beginnings_ in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to frame 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for _complete_.;;1) [[yukina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukina)] 3-11-2006(172): Make the **perfect** impression in the _beginning_ by removing your shoes upon entering a Japanese _home_.;2) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 2-12-2007(154): In the beginning, Adam and Eve had a home in Eden. It was **perfect**.;3) [[kokeshidoll17](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kokeshidoll17)] 20-8-2008(51): Their new _house_ was the **perfect** place to _begin_ a family.;4) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 10-4-2009(30): At the _beginning_ of the party the _house_ was **perfect**. Now look at it!;5) [[zanthan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zanthan)] 31-12-2006(29): My idea of **perfect** is just the _two_ of us ( _human legs_ ) under one _roof_. Like how it was _original_ ly, _in the beginning_ of our relationship. He _completes_ me. 完全 [かんぜん] (adj-na,n) **perfect** ion, completeness, (P) 完璧 [かんぺき] (adj-na) **perfect** , complete, flawless, (P).
宣;proclaim;Under the primitive for _house_ we meet the kanji for _span_. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching:  " **proclaiming** the good news to all nations " and "shouting it from the _housetops_. " That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising.;;1) [[frychiko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/frychiko)] 14-2-2008(304): You can **proclaim** your opinions from the comfort of your HOUSE and have it SPAN the entire globe these days via The Internet.;2) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 27-8-2007(59): I heard young Muslims have to memorise the Koran and **proclaim** it aloud as a kind of rite of passage. Imagine the SPAN of hours spent under a ROOF practising that! It must surely be worse than trying to get through Heisigs RTK - count yourself lucky.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 25-10-2007(42): A local official **proclaim** s a curfew _spanning_ sunset to sunrise - you must stay under your own _roof_ during that time _span_. I keep wanting to add in the "words" 言 primitive. Don't think about someone reading it aloud - focus on the CURFEW that was **proclaim** ed. I also tend to confuse this one with [imperial edict](../v4/342.html) (#342 詔). Remember this proclamation comes from a petty local official.;4) [[tstuhldreher](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher)] 16-6-2008(36): I keep thinking about the Irish one-hit band the **Proclaim** ers, who promised to walk 500 miles – quite a long SPAN – to reach your HOUSE.;5) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 26-2-2008(23): **Proclaim** something loud enough that **spans** the **roof** tops.
宵;wee hours;As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a _house_ with a _candle_ in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is  "burning the _candle_ at both ends, " and working night after night into the **wee hours**.;;1) [[mikes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikes)] 7-5-2007(239): I burn the CANDLE in my HOUSE until the **WEE HOURS** reviewing the kanji!!!;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 3-4-2008(87): I agree with elktapestry. This kanji really means "early evening", not "wee hours" [Heisig really should have done his homework on this and several other characters (e.g., #145 "but of course" – what the hell???). Oh well.] "Every _house_ lights _candles_ in the EARLY EVENING which stay lit until the **wee hours** ". E.G. 宵の口 （よいのくち）early evening, 今宵 （こよい）this evening, tonight.;3) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 27-3-2007(55): The fixed definition of this Kanji that Hesig gives seems deceptive and misleading. This not only refers to **wee hours** of the morning but also Evening and Early Night. So it seems to span the whole range of times when one might need a candle to work within the confines of one's house without daylight. Shows me that I can never trust one source of information exclusively, especially not Hesig. I thank him for this sytem of memorization, but still…;4) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 8-2-2007(12): In the log _house_ the **wee hours** are spent studying by _candle_ light.;5) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 9-5-2008(5): In the **wee hours** I usually stay at _home_ lit by a _candle_ playing with my _little_ bit of _flesh_ until it bears _resemblance_ to a _candle_.
安;relax;To be told that the place of the _woman_ is in the _house_ may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of **relaxing** after a hard day's work: the scruffy and weary _woman_ of the _house_ slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap.;;1) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 27-3-2007(142): It's funny, Hesig gives no Kanji in his book that means cheap/inexpensive… well… if you were wondering what Kanji would carry that meaning, look no further. Sometimes I wonder if Hesig just thinks our little brains would be too easily confused by multiple meanings. Regardless, think of that woman **relax** ing. Cheapest place to do that is in one's own home rather than at some fancy resort, eh? [家で休暇を取るは安いですね。](midori://search?text=家で休暇を取るは安いですね。) .;2) [[enerccio](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enerccio)] 22-7-2007(83): You can only **relax** , when you have woman under roof to do all chores.;3) [[Po0py](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Po0py)] 20-12-2008(65): Cheapest place for a woman to **relax** is in her own home.;4) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 22-3-2008(31): To me, this kanji has always meant "cheap/inexpensive." The way to remember this kanji is: A woman under a roof is cheap, because she isn't off spending your money! Now you'll never forget it!;5) [[mhheie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie)] 21-1-2008(22): No one who has ever been to Japan could have failed to notice the **relax** ed life of the housewifes. While the husband slaves 14 hours a day at work, the _woman_ of the _house_ meets up with friends in cafes, takes piano lessons, goes shopping (no wonder Heizig didn't want to use **cheap** as keyword), watch TV dramas…oh, and take care of their 1.2 (and going down) children. A _woman_ in a _house_ is the perfect symbol for _relax_.
宴;banquet;To carry on from the last frame, we note the entire _day_ of work that comes between a _woman_ and her _house_ in preparing for a dinner **banquet** , pictorially "interrupting" her _relaxation_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(216): The WOMAN spent all DAY preparing a **banquet** in the HOUSE.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 12-4-2008(88): Under the _roof_ , all _day_ long, the _woman_ prepared for the **banquet** (this wording helps me remember the order of this kanji's elements).;3) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 15-11-2007(42): The _woman_ cannot relax 安 in her _house_ because she only has one _day_ to prepare a **banquet**.;4) [[General_Maxon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/General_Maxon)] 24-11-2009(10): An entire _day_ of work for the **banquet** stands between the _woman_ and the _relaxation_ in her _house_.;5) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 29-1-2009(9): To prepare for a **BANQUET** , you need to stay in the HOUSE whole DAY, and you need the help of a WOMAN!
寄;draw near;Let the idea of **drawing near** suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a _strange house_ \- perhaps the haunted _House_ of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread _House_ that lured Hansel and Gretel to **draw near**.;;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 14-11-2007(195): The _strange house_ has a sign saying "DRAW NEAR" in its window, instead of a 'Beware' sign. It must be a trick!;2) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 9-10-2007(66): Imagine a horror movie set in a haunted mansion. The _house_ is very _strange_. The characters **draw near** to one another for protection against the unknown.;3) [[jonny49cc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonny49cc)] 17-7-2008(54): There is something strange in this house. Do you dare to **draw near**?;4) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 12-4-2007(24): Hans and Gretel slowly and carefully **drew near** the _strange_ gingerbread _house_ in the clearing.;5) [[lexuten](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lexuten)] 15-8-2008(19): As I **draw near** , I see something strang in the house.
富;wealth;Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for **wealth** is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the **wealth** is kept under the roof of the same _house_.;;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 10-9-2007(102): Remember Ducktales? That rich duck had that room in his house where he kept all the **wealth**! He had so much in that house you could even swim in it!;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(88): In ancient Japan, a RICE FIELD is a unit of **wealth** as it can produce enough to feed all the MOUTHs in ONE HOUSE.;3) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 9-11-2008(36): A HOUSE with only ONE MOUTH and a RICE FIELD has a lot of **WEALTH**.;4) [[MRT88](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MRT88)] 23-9-2009(16): The family kept all the **wealth** under one _roof_.;5) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 23-1-2008(8): **Wealth** can be assessed only when it's under the _roof_.
貯;savings;To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of **savings** as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but _shells_ , a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The _nail_ under the roof of the _house_ points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one's _shells_ for safekeeping.;;1) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 9-10-2007(158): It takes a lot more than one _clam_ of **savings** to buy a _house_ on a _street_.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 17-6-2008(68): My **SAVINGS** plan - I _nail_ my _money_ bags up in the rafters below my _roof_. I'm very secretive about it, and I wear a disguise with a big **mustache** (another meaning of this kanji) while I stash my loot.;3) [[trurlo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trurlo)] 14-2-2011(56): **savings** = _money_ kept under the _roof_ rather than spent on the _street_.;4) [[CountPacula](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula)] 18-4-2008(53): **Savings** are the _clams_ you have _nailed_ down under your _roof_.;5) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 27-8-2007(14): A slightly smarter guy has all of his **SAVINGS** \- in the form of **shells** \- **nailed up** just under the eaves of the **floating roof**.
木;tree;Here we see a pictograph of a **tree** , showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for _water_ (Frame 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.;* As a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean _tree_ or _wood_. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk, we shall change its meaning to _pole_ , or _wooden pole_.;1) [[liosama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama)] 28-6-2008(137): If you need a story for a **tree** , then you need to be hit by one.;2) [[beth266](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/beth266)] 2-8-2009(18): Pictograph of a **tree**.;3) [[fiminor](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fiminor)] 16-3-2007(10): As a primitive, I often use Tolkein's Ents as they have more scope for adventure than ordinary inanimate **tree** s.;4) [[pjdekl](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pjdekl)] 28-1-2010(9): _<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaRBrHxNcFA>_ watch it!;5) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 16-10-2007(7): [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The **tree** ( 木 ) is not yet ( 末 ) vermilion ( 朱 ).
林;grove;Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A **grove** is a small cluster of _trees_. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for _tree_ gives us the **grove**.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 30-7-2007(92): A **grove** has at least two TREEs.;2) [[coolbananas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/coolbananas)] 6-3-2009(23): If you need a mnemonic to remember this then you had better give up now!;3) [[hornlo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hornlo)] 15-5-2011(12): [ **grove** = _tree_ \+ _tree_ ] - a **grove** is between a single [tree](../v4/195.html) (#195 木) and a many-treed [forest](../v4/197.html) (#197 森).;4) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 21-12-2007(6): Two _trees_ together make up a **GROVE**.;5) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 8-6-2008(4): "I must…safe guard the **GROVE** " says the Keeper of the **Grove** as he uses his treant ability to cast TWO TREE minions. (warcraft III reference).
森;forest;A **forest** is a large expanse of _trees_ , or " _trees_ , _trees_ everywhere, " to adopt the expression we used back in frames 22 and 23.;;1) [[sharak10](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sharak10)] 27-10-2007(60): The higher you go up a mountain the less trees there are, that's so u dont mess up with their possition like i do.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 21-12-2007(32): Another _tree_ planted within a _grove_ turns it into a **FOREST**.;3) [[axisj](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axisj)] 2-8-2009(14): Many Trees make a **forest**.;4) [[KREVA](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KREVA)] 13-9-2008(12): A triangle of _trees_ is all that's needed to depict a **forest**.;5) [[Kimya](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kimya)] 4-11-2011(8): A triforce of trees makes a **forest**.
桂;Japanese Judas-tree;Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a **Japanese Judas- tree** looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a _tree_ with _ivy_ growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman's rope.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 26-1-2006(158): Simple mnemonic : "The **Japanese Judas-tree** is the _tree_ on which Judas hang himself to the _ivy_ " (Judas the traitor of the Christian bible). Just picture Judas hanging himself, using _ivy_ as a if it was a rope.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 6-1-2008(92): A _tree_ covered in poison _ivy_ will quickly betray you, thus the name **JAPANESE JUDAS-TREE**.;3) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 2-3-2008(35): The **Katsura** ( **Japanese Judas-tree** ) is a thin _tree_ (sort of like the stretched out 木 used in this kanji) with little green (the color of an emerald, a _jewel_ ) leaves. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsura_>(tree).;4) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 4-8-2008(15): Japanese JEWEL TREE sounds like JUDAS-tree.;5) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 28-3-2007(13): Interesting… this tree is called a かつら (Katura) Tree in Japan. It got the **Japanese Judas-Tree** distinction because it bears a similar leaf-type to the Judas Tree found in Europe and such. For fun word-play with both the Judas & Katsura distinctions… it might be good to learn that a homonym for Katsura (w/different Kanji 鬘) is a hairpiece or wig! So now imagine some dishevled business man with a funny hairpiece stringing ivy around the Katsura/Judas tree to hang himself with!!
柏;oak;This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the "golden bough." As you may recall, what made the sacred **oak** in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome  "golden" were the _white_ berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don't know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji - which of course you won't - the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.);;1) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 12-8-2007(121): The wood from **oak** _trees_ can be used to make barrels in which _white_ wine is aged. What's more, I love _white_ wine with an **oaky** flavour…;2) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 31-3-2008(104): An **oak** _tree_ is _white_ , from left to right!;3) [[Mesqueeb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb)] 1-2-2009(69): [Pokemon] Ash :: "Going to **Oak** for my first Pokemon!" Mom :: " **Oak** , **Oak**? That _tree_?" Ash :: "Noo! Professor **Oak**! You know, he always wears a _white_ coat!" Mom :: "Okay dear! Don't forget clean underwear!".;4) [[lbphenom](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lbphenom)] 28-1-2008(39): The white tree of Minas Tirith was an **oak**!;5) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 19-10-2011(13): Prof. **Oak** ( オオキド博士 to Japanese fans) is named after a tree and has white hair.
枠;frame;You might think of the **frame** this character refers to as the sort of **frame** we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin _wood_ , and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the _nine_ and the _ten_.;;1) [[alkulp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alkulp)] 22-10-2007(176): **wood** at **90 (9 * 10)** degrees.;2) [[javiergakusei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei)] 24-10-2007(93): Nine out of ten picture **frame** s are made out of wood. The rest are made of metal or plastic.;3) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 11-12-2010(40): A good _wood_ en **frame** has perfect right angles at each corner: _ninety_ degrees at each one. 枠 (わく) : **frame** , slide.;4) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 8-5-2008(12): **Nine- tenths** of all **frame** s are made of **wood** (9 over 10).;5) [[Es2Key](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Es2Key)] 27-1-2011(9): Wooden **frame** 9x10.
梢;treetops;As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing _candles_ to the branches of evergreen _trees_ , it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the **treetops** to fix _candles_ on the _tree_.;;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 30-9-2007(184): At Christmas time, on the **treetops** , people used to place great big _candles_ (Now we usually place a star instead).;2) [[Tatiana](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tatiana)] 22-10-2006(46): If you cut off the **treetops** , they still _resemble_ the _trees_ they used to be part of. **Treetops** = _tree_ _resemblance_.;3) [[astgtciv](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv)] 14-4-2007(25): A gigantic _candle_ is standing to the right of the _tree_ , the flame rising higher than the **treetops**.;4) [[Ji_suss](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ji_suss)] 24-8-2008(17): Doesn't really mean **treetops**. It means the end of a branch. In English, the name for each year's new growth at the end of every branch is a "candle". Same in Japanese.;5) [[LeoOra](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LeoOra)] 28-2-2008(12): The tops of the trees, as in the fractal theory, resembles a whole tree if you look from afar.
棚;shelf;One often thinks of books as "good _companions_ ," but here it is the **shelf** we store them on that is the _companion_. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, _wood_ , and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 11-10-2007(247): A **shelf** is a _wooden companion_ to books.;2) [[TaylorSan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TaylorSan)] 2-3-2009(75): I think of an Otaku, with a _wooden_ **shelf** full of anime action figure statures, who are sadly his only _companions_.;3) [[komodo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/komodo)] 17-6-2008(28): My ideal _companion_ would have an ass I could use as a **shelf**. Just look at those two _flesh_ y hemispheres. The association of _wood_ should come easily.;4) [[joxn_costello](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello)] 22-11-2008(14): A **shelf** is made out of _wood_ , and it is a _companion_ to books. But most importantly for me, the _two moons_ look like the spines of hardbound books standing next to one another as _companions_ on a **shelf**.;5) [[terozen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/terozen)] 25-3-2012(7): A _wooden_ **shelf** is the perfect _companion_ to all my lovely books!
杏;apricot;Since **apricots** can be eaten just as they fall from the _trees_ , picture this _mouth_ agape at the bottom of a _tree_ (just as the elements have it), waiting for **apricots** to fall into it.;;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 21-12-2007(195): From the _tree_ straight into the _mouth_ is the best way to eat an **APRICOT**!;2) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 8-9-2006(37): Imagine Totoro sleeping under his _tree_. As he snores a giant **apricot** falls nicely into his open _mouth_ and he emits a giant burp of satisfaction. I can hear that music alreay….to - to to - to - ro…;3) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 12-8-2007(28): If you eat **apricot** s too fast, you'll end up eating the pits too. And we all know what happens then - an **apricot** tree will grow out of your mouth.;4) [[oohansel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oohansel)] 9-8-2009(18): The **apricot** fell from the TREE into my MOUTH.;5) [[jabberwockychortles](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles)] 24-2-2009(7): I lay under the **apricot** _tree_ and let the delicious **apricot** s drop into my _mouth_.
桐;paulownia;Since you probably don't know what a **paulownia** _tree_ is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase  "the Little Brothers of St. **Paulownia.** " It is a short step to associate the _tree_ with the _monks_ to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental _tree_ really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.);;1) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 29-3-2007(371): In Japan, a **paulownia** (きり）is known as the "princess tree". It was once a traditional TREE planted at the SAME time as the birth of a daughter. It would grow fast enough that, at the time of her wedding, it could be used to make a dresser as a wedding present for her.;2) [[akira](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akira)] 1-2-2007(98): **Paulownia** is a Japanese tree which looks same as any other tree.;3) [[zardoz73](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zardoz73)] 8-2-2013(32): In the forest, there's a tree that my goofy friend PAUL claims he OWNS. I think he's nuts, because the tree looks the SAME as all the others.In Japan, a **paulownia** (きり）is known as the "princess tree".;4) [[totokan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/totokan)] 6-11-2007(12): Also called Phoenix tree. After the wood is harvested the tree regenerates from its roots. The same tree comes up again.;5) [[gagge_tah](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gagge_tah)] 13-8-2009(7): Paul owns the _same_ _tree_ as everyone else, a **paulownia**. // not every tree as in [plum](../v4/460.html) (#460 梅).
植;plant;You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to **plant** a young _tree_ and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up _straight_.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(273): **Plant** s don't become _tree_ s _straightaway_.;2) [[liosama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/liosama)] 28-6-2008(109): When you **plant** **plant** s, you use a piece of WOOD to make the **plant** grow STRAIGHT.;3) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 10-9-2007(33): If you get a new tree it is of course best to go **plant** it straightaway. Without **plant** ing it straightaway the roots won't have enough time to be healthy and strong like the tree needs.;4) [[JohninJapan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JohninJapan)] 9-1-2007(19): **PLANT** a TREE with tottoro and it might start growing STRAIGHTAWAY. (see tonari no tottoro :D).;5) [[kuraujiokun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kuraujiokun)] 10-7-2009(11): To **plant** : act of putting that small _tree_ _straight_ into the ground.
椅;chair;Instead of making a **chair** out of wood from a _tree_ , this kanji has us making the whole _tree_ into a **chair** , which looks most _strange_ sitting in your living room where the sofa used to be.;;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 11-6-2007(156): To the Japanese, the first time they saw a **chair** , it looked like a _strange_ use of _wood_! Probably why they still like to sit on the floor…;2) [[Earthlark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Earthlark)] 15-2-2011(29): <Http://www.pooktre.com/>.;3) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 6-10-2007(14): A _strange_ kind of _tree_ grows in the shape of a **chair**.;4) [[blannk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk)] 29-10-2009(8): Traditionally a _wooden_ **chair** would have been a _strange_ object in a Japanese home.;5) [[KanjiVirtuoso](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KanjiVirtuoso)] 29-4-2012(1): _Wooden_ rocking **chair** s must've seemed pretty _strange_ to those seeing them for the first time.
枯;wither;What makes a _tree_ begin to **wither** up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple _old age_ , as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled _old tree_ , **withering** away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over.;;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 16-10-2007(189): A tree **wither** s away as it gets old.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 15-11-2007(68): When flowers get old they _suffer_ (frame 225), but _old trees_ just **WITHER** away painlessly. (Picture flowers crying in pain, but a dried up tree silent and sad).;3) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 28-1-2008(17): The _tree_ is _old_ and **withered**.;4) [[chibimizuno](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno)] 15-3-2009(7): I had trouble remembering this one using tree and old, so I just thought of what the _wood_ of an _old_ man would look like, and that did the trick.;5) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 29-5-2006(7): When flowers get old they are said to be _suffering_ (225) but there is no sympathy for the poor _old tree_ which simply **wither** s!
朴;crude;As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one's _wand_ out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the _wood_. For the magic of the _wand_ derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its **crude** , natural state.;;1) [[simple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/simple)] 12-9-2007(153): _Wooden wands_ are the **crudest**. They are nothng compared to their carbon fibre equivilents.;2) [[wingedge](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wingedge)] 17-12-2007(78): A beginner magician starts with a **crude** _wooden magic wand_. Later he'll upgrade to magicite, of course.;3) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 4-9-2008(40): You can make a **crude** magic wand from any tree.;4) [[chibimizuno](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chibimizuno)] 16-9-2009(25): First year boys at Hogwarts tend to compare their _wood_ to their _wand_ , but this is considered **crude** behavior.;5) [[RobMow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow)] 3-7-2009(22): This guy is so **crude** he doesn't face the tree when he relieves himself.
村;town;The character for _village_ was associated with _rice fields_ (Frame 96). That for **town** , a step up on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of _trees glued together_ to measure off the confines of a **town**.;;1) [[zhangqiezi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zhangqiezi)] 29-5-2008(230): If you've ever played an old 8 bit or 16 bit RPG, like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy or Inindou, you'll remember that every _town_ was all bordered off by a line of _trees_ with no space in between to get out through. Imagine that the trees were _glued together_ so you could only exit **town** through the main or side gates, (so you couldn't escape the important scripted scenes.).;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 3-4-2009(162): Pfft. At it's core, a **town** is just a bunch of _wood_ _glued_ together. Edit - Stop starring this piece of crap story! xD.;3) [[Sunday](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sunday)] 8-3-2008(65): There is a mix up, this kanji means むら=village, not **town**. The one for **town** is まち = 町 . 100% shure because my teacher is native Japanese.;4) [[Kieron](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron)] 3-7-2007(57): I swap the _town/village_ keywords. See also [village](../v4/92.html) (#92 町). As the old Siberian joke went, there's nothing to do in a small rural **village** but count ( _measure_ ) the _trees_.;5) [[MikeNeko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MikeNeko)] 21-6-2008(48): 村 means village! See [village](../v4/92.html) (#92 町). Please don't get them confused like Heisig seems to have done. Story: See the _tree_ s surround the little **village** so densely it looks like they are _glued_ together. Imagine a little village on a hillside surrounded by trees with glue dripping off the trees.
相;inter-;The prefix **inter-** stirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: _tree_ . . . _eye_. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one's own _eye_ before helping your neighbors with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for **inter-** human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji!;;1) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 25-3-2008(225): The prime minister is having **inter-** course behind that _tree_! All you can see are his _eyes_ poking out from the righthand-side of the _tree_.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 8-4-2008(94): ソウ/ショウ/あ INTER /MUTUAL /ASPECT /PHASE /MINISTER. "Long ago, before there were telephones, people living far from one another would climb _trees_ to _eye_ each other's aspects and **inter-** act for their mutual benefit. Those who did this best became government _ministers_ , with the top person (perhaps the one with the longest neck ( 首 , [neck](../v4/70.html) (#70 首)) becoming the prime _minister_ [「首相](midori://search?text=「首相) (しゅしょう)".;3) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 16-10-2007(39): I changed my story to remind myself there are other primary meanings for this character: The Minister of _Trees_ has a good _eye_ for **inter-** action.;4) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 26-2-2008(30): A piece of wood went "inter" my eye. This is an internal injury.;5) [[meredithcat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meredithcat)] 29-6-2010(25): **Inter** course usually occurs between two people lying beneath a _tree_ , gazing into each other's _eyes_.
机;desk;We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for **desk** : the wonderful rough _wood_ of which it has been hewn and the _wind_ that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character.;;1) [[Kieron](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kieron)] 3-4-2007(170): My _wooden_ **desk** is so messy, it looks like a strong _wind_ blew my things all over it.;2) [[Elphalpo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo)] 19-1-2008(101): Whenever I'm alone at my computer **desk** , I'm always getting _wood_ and breaking _wind_.;3) [[shimouma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma)] 23-3-2008(40): The tree was blown down by the wind - so I made a **desk** from it.;4) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 15-11-2007(18): Studying at my _wooden_ **desk** , a great _wind_ sweeps away all my papers - there goes all my hard work - I can see all the kanji disappearing into the sky.;5) [[trikatu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trikatu)] 3-10-2006(8): A _tree_ blown over in the _wind_ makes a **desk**.
本;book;Recalling that **books** are made of paper, and paper made of _trees_ , one might think of a **book** as a slice of a _tree_. Can you seethe  "cross-cut" in the trunk of the _tree_? Picture it as a chainsaw cutting you out a few **books** with which to start your own private library.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(73): The origin of a **book** is paper made out of TREEs. ONE tree can make many **book** s.;2) [[ggwar](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ggwar)] 7-8-2009(25): A **book** is _one_ slice of a _tree_.;3) [[burento5](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/burento5)] 14-3-2008(24): An axe cutting a tree to make **book** s.;4) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 10-7-2006(11): **Book** s are the root of all knowledge (in Chinese this character means root or basis).;5) [[Raitasar](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raitasar)] 6-5-2009(5): Sad 'Fact': You have to _cut_ down _ten_ oriental _tree_ s just to produce one **book**!
札;tag;The **tags** you see hanging on _trees_ in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of _trees_ they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the **tag** to the branch as a large _fishhook_. REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(173): Botanists like to identify TREEs by HOOKing **tag** s on them.;2) [[elktapestry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elktapestry)] 30-3-2007(69): Might be good to note that this is also the Kanji for "Paper Money" w/ the reading さつ ( [千円札＝](midori://search?text=千円札＝) 1000 Yen paper bill)… It also takes on the meaning of Playing Card with the reading of ふだ as in 花札 (Hanafuda cards) or トランプの札 ("trump" playing cards). For the **tag** meaning I like to think of wooden **tag** s hung on hooks from trees… but for these other meanings I like to think of both paper money and playing cards as paper (tree) products with the ability to "hook you in" so to speak.;3) [[peepiceek](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek)] 5-5-2008(20): In order to put a **tag** on a _tree_ you need a _hook_.;4) [[xxinde](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xxinde)] 30-3-2010(12): A **tag** was _hook_ ed on a _tree_. Since the **tag** was actually a banknote (さつ), it's no wonder that it's gone now and only the _hook_ remains sticking out from a _tree_.;5) [[certain](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/certain)] 17-4-2006(9): A little piece of paper (wood) attached by a hook makes a **TAG**.
暦;calendar;Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for _days_ , an appropriate enough way to begin a **calendar**. Next we see a _grove of trees_ growing under a _cliff_. The laws of nature being what they are, the _trees_ would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the _days_ on your wall **calendar** , you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that _grove of trees_ each month, from January under the _cliff_ to December on top of the _cliff_. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a **calendar** nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind.;;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 15-11-2007(241): Years-Months-Days: It takes many years for a _cliff_ to form or erode. A _tree_ takes many months to grow. But _days_ pass by regularly - so in this way, we see the movement of time such as with a **CALENDAR**.;2) [[cbogart](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cbogart)] 21-9-2006(122): This is just a picture of a wall **calendar** with a page for each month. The bottom half has the grid of days, the top half has a pretty picture of a forest this month. The cliff radical here is the top and left edges of the paper. You can see the paper curling up at the lower left where a breeze is trying to turn the page.;3) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(68): You can use a **calendar** to count the number of DAYs it takes to grow two TREES under a CLIFF.;4) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 13-1-2009(47): **Calendar, almanac.** A **calendar** measures time in years, months and days. A _cliff_ (厂) takes years to form, a _grove_ ( 木木 ) of trees takes months to grow, but the _sun_ ( 日 ) rises and falls every day. All of these periods can be recorded in a **calendar**.;5) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 1-9-2008(28): I love those nature **CALENDAR** s with all the photos of _cliffs_ and _trees_ and the setting _sun_.
案;plan;Without much effort, the elements _relax_ . . . _tree_ suggest a hammock strung between two _trees_ in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, **planning** something or other. After all, it's something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best **plan** of action to take. Be sure to relate the _relaxation_ to the _tree_ , so that you don't end up with something else in its place (like "legs" or "desk" or "table").;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(250): I **plan** to RELAX on top of that TREE.;2) [[MichaelAnd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MichaelAnd)] 15-4-2008(189): If you bring a woman to your house, generally its not a good **plan** to stick your wood up her bottom, she may scream in pain あん!;3) [[dziewuliz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dziewuliz)] 3-5-2008(133): Man's **plan** of life: build a house, find a woman, **plan** t a tree.;4) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 17-6-2008(31): Calvin and Hobbes sit in their _treehouse_ , which has a big "no _girls_ " sign on it, deviously making their **PLAN** for their next water-balloon attack against the 'stinky girls'.;5) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 14-8-2007(29): How can you relax when you have a tree jammed up your ass?! Quickly make a **plan** to get down from there!
燥;parch;**Parch** ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial **parch** ment from _wood_ pulp. The _fire_ at the left and in the  "strong" position serves to remind us of the root word, " **parch** ," since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like _fire_. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a  " _wood-good_ ,"), wet it, and hold it over a _hearth_ in your mind's eye. Now watch as it **parches** the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling **parch** ment.;;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 14-2-2008(273): Tip: _goods_ \+ _wood/tree_ : This combination of primitives appears four times in Heisig, so it's worthwhile giving it a name. I suggest " _furniture_ " (a common type of _wooden goods_ ). REF: _parch_ (FRAME 215) , [maneuver](../v4/671.html) (#671 操), [winding](../v4/1369.html) (#1369 繰), [seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻). Story: It's been so **parch** ed recently that your _furniture_ suddenly catches _fire_.;2) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(76): The **parch** ment says you need _fire_ to make _good_ s from _tree_ s.;3) [[crayonmaster](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crayonmaster)] 24-1-2009(42): When a FIRE is **parch** ed, it isn't thirsty for water, it wants to gobble up some WOODEN GOODIES!;4) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 5-4-2008(33): ソウ "A _fire's_ heat will **parch** /dry out any _goods_ made from _wood_." E.G. 乾燥する （かんそう・する）to dry up.;5) [[LazyNomad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad)] 12-1-2010(29): Hint: Actually the element - 喿 - is itself a rare kanji, that has the meaning of "chirping of birds" (see these little mouthes on the tree). On - ソウ/ ショウ Kun さわ.ぐ/ かしま.しい/すき.
未;not yet;As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a _tree_ that is **not yet** fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the _tree_ has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the _tree_.;;1) [[dat5h](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h)] 15-11-2008(148): I believe a better version of that by mameha1977: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) does **not yet** ( 未 ) have exremities ( 末 ) of vermilion ( 朱 ).;2) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 16-10-2007(64): [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is **not yet** ( 末 ) vermilion ( 朱 ).;3) [[DeadLugosi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DeadLugosi)] 13-8-2008(41): This TREE is **not yet** fully grown: it's only ONE year old.;4) [[Ameyama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ameyama)] 26-2-2008(41): "Have you sawed off those two smaller branches at the top of the tree?" "Not yet…".;5) [[squeaky_lill_mk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/squeaky_lill_mk)] 5-4-2009(20): The top branch of the tree is **not yet** as long as the bottom one.
末;extremity;This character is best learned in connection with that of the previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the **extremity** of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later.;;1) [[amema](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amema)] 20-11-2007(108): The tree has reached the **extremity** of its growth and no longer produces small, new branches at the top. Instead the existing top branch just grows longer and longer.;2) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 8-4-2008(30): There are no great stories for this one yet, and I always forget it.. So, let's try something ridiculous: The man lived by himself in the wilderness, with no females within miles. So, his only way of relief was to stick his **extremity** into a small hole in a _tree_.. The poor guy. Which horizontal stroke is the **extremity**? The longer one or the shorter one? That, my friends, is up to your own imaginations. I'd prefer not to dwell on that point, myself. ,).;3) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 13-3-2008(29): The **tree's** top branches have grown to **extremities**.;4) [[NyahK](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK)] 3-12-2009(23): Another version of that by mameha1977 and dat5h: [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The _tree_ ( 木 ) has _not yet_ ( 未 ) reached the **extremity** ( 末 ) of its _vermilion_ ( 朱 ) foliage.;5) [[arthur](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/arthur)] 18-1-2009(9): It's near the upper **extremity** of the tree that grows the larger branches.
昧;obscure;The most **obscure** ideas are those that the _sun_ of reason has _not yet_ dawned on. Be sure to give the _sun_ a professorial demeanor, complete with spectacles and a pipe.;;1) [[Aerin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aerin)] 18-11-2007(90): Something that is **obscure** has _not yet_ been brought before the light of _day_.;2) [[to_nihon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon)] 11-1-2009(48): 'Can't you go outside and get some _sun_?' ' _Not yet_ , I have to learn all these **obscure** RTK3 kanji!'.;3) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 15-2-2007(10): Things look **obscure** when the _sun_ is _not yet_ out.;4) [[decals](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decals)] 11-11-2010(6): Unlike us, some people finish RTK 1 and think "Should I learn all those **obscure** kanji in RTK 3? Nah, NOT YET. I'll learn them some other DAY." We're just extra Kanji sadistic. (Although, I should say, this kanji is not very **obscure**. 曖昧 is in the vocab list for JLPT level 2).;5) [[FoxintheStars](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars)] 31-7-2010(5): An **obscure** artist or personage is one whose _day in the sun_ has _not yet_ come.
沫;splash;The **splash** this kanji refers to is the dash of _water_ against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a **splash** in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its _extremity_ , namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind's eye, this somewhat rare (but oh so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(153): The _extremity_ of a wave of _water_ is the **splash**.;2) [[gametip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gametip)] 21-7-2008(78): A **splash** is WATER that has reached its EXTREMITY.;3) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 12-7-2007(34): Timber! …the _extremity_ of the tree fell into the _water_ the nearby lake. What a **splash**!!;4) [[eri401](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401)] 8-6-2012(13): **SPLASH** = _water_ being scattered to the _extreme_ 泡沫 = うたかた, ほうまつ = bubble on surface of liquid, transient o マツ o バツ k あわ k しぶき k つばき.;5) [[dicedice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice)] 31-10-2008(10): Imagine the _extremity_ of a **splash** attack from a magikarp.
味;flavor;When a tree has _not yet_ finished growing, it produces fruit with a full **flavor**. When the official taster (the professional _mouth_ to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently _not yet_ grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of **flavor** hidden in this character.;;1) [[lilpea](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lilpea)] 17-8-2007(251): My _mouth_ has _not yet_ swallowed the food because the **flavor** is so delicious that I keep chewing it.;2) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 6-4-2008(134): To enjoy a food's **FLAVOR** , it must be in one's MOUTH but NOT YET swallowed.;3) [[NyahK](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK)] 2-8-2010(51): "Not in my _mouth_!" she cried. " _Not yet_! You know how much I hate the **flavor**!" (I know, the story is silly… but it works!).;4) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 17-10-2007(14): My _mouth_ is _not yet_ ready to taste the **flavor** of a tree.;5) [[raijne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raijne)] 24-8-2011(8): My _mouth_ has _not yet_ experienced such **FLAVOR**.
妹;younger sister;The **younger sister** in the family is the _woman_ in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is _not yet_ old enough or mature enough to do everything the elder sister can do (See frame 442).;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(172): My **younger sister** is NOT YET a fully grown WOMAN.;2) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 12-6-2007(50): Is your **younger sister** a woman?

朱;vermilion;That red-orange color we call **vermilion** is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the _drop_ hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has _not yet_ fallen as it one day must. Look at its color - vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, **vermilion** is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I'm sure you will agree that autumn leaves area lot easier to work with.);;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(204): It's autumn: only one **vermilion** leaf on the tree has _not yet_ fallen.;2) [[solarmist](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/solarmist)] 30-6-2008(29): [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is not yet ( 未 )[correction wrong character before] **vermilion** ( 朱 ).;3) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 22-2-2009(20): **VERMILION** is the color of the last leaves on the TREE which have NOT YET fallen in autumn.;4) [[jabberwockychortles](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles)] 21-6-2009(13): [Cheat] Remember these as a set: The tree ( 木 ) is not yet ( 未 ) **vermilion** ( 朱 ).

株;stocks;The **stocks** bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy _tree_ , in which one takes " **stock** " in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more _trees_ like itself. Usually good **stocks** are referred to as  "blue chip," but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color _vermilion_ , perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves.;;1) [[cellophane](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cellophane)] 12-10-2007(306): Which _tree_ would you buy **stocks** in - the healthy one on the left, or the one with only one _vermilion_ leaf left on the right?;2) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 2-3-2007(145): Ideally, one buys **stocks** when a company is young, "green," and rapidly growing – then sells them just before the last vermillion leaf falls off, and a period of dormancy or limited growth begins.;3) [[shimouma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma)] 27-3-2008(40): I have a hot tip for you. Buy **stocks** in a company called "Tree and Vermillion Ltd".;4) [[CarlKenner](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CarlKenner)] 7-7-2007(25): Don't think of the **stock** -market. Instead imagine the _wood_ en medieval **stocks** used to hold a prisoner's head and hands between two blocks of _wood_. The _wood_ in this case is _vermilion_ coloured, as it often was. Imagine **SHOO** ING away the guards and blowing the **stocks** open with a big " **kaboo** m" sound. (ON reading SHU, Kun reading kabu).;5) [[oRis1024](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/oRis1024)] 24-7-2008(21): You buy **stocks** when they're new and green like a _normal tree_ and sell it when it's _vermillion-HOT_ and pricy.
若;young;Here we see a _flower_ held in the _right_ hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where _flowers_ picked with the _right_ hand grant eternal **youth** , and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens.;;1) [[Ramchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip)] 30-10-2006(165): The **young** little girl held a cute flower in her right hand.;2) [[kat1420](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kat1420)] 19-3-2008(71): **Young** love puts a _flower_ in her _right_ hand (true love puts a ring on her left!!).;3) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 10-4-2008(24): Imagine Alice reading a note in Wonderland: 'The _flowers_ on the _right_ will make you **younger**.

A man holding FLOWERs (well, better than GRASS) in his RIGHT hand.
草;grass;Perhaps you know the custom of seeding **grass** randomly or in some particular pattern with the _flower_ called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in _early_ spring. As the **grass** begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny _flowers_ dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of **grass** somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name spelled out in _flowers_ once as a sort of _early_ harbinger of spring.;;1) [[dicedice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice)] 22-7-2007(266): **Grass** grows in _earlier_ than _flowers_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 1-6-2008(46): This **grass** is very long.

苦;suffering;The picture of **suffering** we are given here is that of a _flower_ that has grown _old_. When a _flower_ ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even **suffers**. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better.;;1) [[applesuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki)] 20-9-2006(190): Flowers for the old man **suffering** in the hospital.;2) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 9-5-2007(26): The derivates from opium _poppies_ such as morphine can be used to tame the **suffering** of the _old_.;3) [[MichaelAnd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MichaelAnd)] 21-4-2008(20): Old people smoke pot to ease their **suffering**.;4) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 26-12-2009(18): FLOWERS **SUFFER** when they grow OLD. Trees slowly wither( 枯 ) and die. I find I can remember these together.;5) [[salvw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/salvw)] 5-12-2008(16): If someone dies you suffer. You then put a _flower_ on the _gravestone_.
苛;bullying;A nosegay of _flowers_ make a nice gift, but if those flowers are poison oak, they _can_ amount to **bullying**. Be sure to emphasize the word _can_ when you repeat this little phrase to yourself.;;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 27-5-2007(68): "How many _flowers_ _can_ I stuff in your nostrils? Well I'm just gonna have to go and see." **Bullying** at its worst!;2) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 16-12-2008(22): The _Little Engine that Could_ , drawing from his own experiences, has become a spokesman against **bullying**. He visits schools with the slogan "Bullying CAN be stopped," and hands out _flowers_ of peace and understanding.;3) [[wrightak](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wrightak)] 4-8-2009(13): 苛める （いじめる） "If you don't give me those _flowers_ , I'll drive this _spike_ into your _mouth_.".;4) [[CountPacula](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula)] 22-12-2008(10): _Flowers_ , you ask if they _can_ feel _pain_ , do you? ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ They sure _-can-_!! ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^ ^stomp^!!;5) [[kanjihito](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito)] 3-11-2012(9): "With _flowers_ , I think I _can_ stop the **bullying** ," said the Little Engine that Could. Indeed the **bullying** stopped, as the tormentors were covered by a trainload of flowers.
寛;tolerant;The _house_ of _flowers_ or  "hothouse" has become a metaphor for a narrow- minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. **Tolerance** , in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage **tolerance** in those who lack it is first to have them _see_ through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(343): A **tolerant** person will ignore SEEing GRASS (marijuana) in the HOUSE of a friend.;2) [[saruwatari](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saruwatari)] 30-12-2007(178): To be **tolerant** is to see flowers (meaning "beautiful things") in every house, instead of looking for drawbacks.;3) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 3-9-2008(82): Kanji Zen: _See_ the _flowers_ in the _house_. _See_ the good in people. Be **TOLERANT**.;4) [[Foddy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Foddy)] 12-11-2007(82): My wife grows flowers in the house and I see them every day. I don't really like them, but I have to be **tolerant**.;5) [[axelb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/axelb)] 21-7-2008(23): Into my _house_ someone brought a monstrous _flower_ with a big, _walking eye_ , _see_ ing everything, like a spy. But I am trying to be **tolerant** , although it is getting on my nerves. Remember: The _flower_ is IN the _house_ (that is, underneath its roof-sign).
薄;dilute;Take a good look at this kanji: the "strong" element here is really the _flower_ , not the _water_ as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the _acupuncturist_ from frame 48. Taking the key word to connote **diluting** the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our _acupuncturist_ performing his task with _flowers_ in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe _water_ into the body of the patient.;;1) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 17-10-2007(173): A _Dr._ missing his needle can only use **dilute** _flower water_ for medicine.;2) [[pm215](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215)] 15-2-2008(112): [As suggested by stehr and on the forum (<http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079>), we create a new keyword 'seaweed' for the _flower_ on top and _water_ below and to the left. See also [fall](../v4/299.html) (#299 落), [clan](../v4/1912.html) (#1912 藩),[seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻). This story is for people using that idea.] The _homeopath_ (a doctor without any needle) specialises in **dilute** medicines. This one's an essence of _seaweed_ – just dip the seaweed into the beaker, swish it about and remove. Barmy!;3) [[stehr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stehr)] 29-12-2007(94): **Note** This character belongs to a set of characters which share the _flower/water_ primitive such as:: [dilute](../v4/227.html) (#227 薄), [fall](../v4/299.html) (#299 落), [clan](../v4/1912.html) (#1912 藩), and [seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻)…. ( 落 薄 藩 藻 ) It may be helpful to create a primitive keyword for this occurrence (like _seaweed_ or _watering can_ ) which can save a lot of time distinguishing them from characters like _Sino_ 満 and _Full_ 満 , where the _water_ primitive is larger than the _flower_ primitive.;4) [[wzafran](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran)] 17-6-2007(22): A man with thick blood dripping out of his hands visits an _acupuncturist_. "Please **dilute** my blood!" he says. The _acupuncturist_ gives the man a seat, punctures his skin with many _flower_ stems, and inserts a _drop of_ cold _water_ through the holes at the top of those stems. The man's blood becomes soft pink in colour . As too much blood had been **diluted** , he dies.;5) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 15-1-2008(19): A homeopathy _specialist_ takes _flowers_ and _dilutes_ them in some _water_ … (picture my hippie aunt with her homeopathist diluting flowers in water.).
葉;leaf;Three elements are given here: _flower_ . . . _generation_ . . . _tree_. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the **leaf** that feeds the _flowers_ on a _tree_. The element for _generation_ interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a _tree_ from one _generation_ to the next is like its  "turning over a new **leaf**. ";;1) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 13-7-2007(246): On top of the **leaves** a _flower_ appears, promising new _generations_ for the old _tree_ below.;2) [[shimouma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shimouma)] 29-3-2008(120): The flower generation spent far too much time up trees trying to smoke leaves.;3) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 13-2-2008(85): Tip: New primitive: Let _Tarzan_ = _generation_ \+ _tree_ – because _Tarzan_ lives with several _generation_ s of his family at the top of a _tree_. (This combination appears five times: _leaf_ (FRAME 228), [butterfly](../v4/521.html) (#521 蝶), [chatter](../v4/2158.html) (#2158 喋), [secret agent](../v4/2726.html) (#2726 諜), [label](../v4/2926.html) (#2926 牒)). Story: In the _flower_ shop you see _Tarzan_ trying on various **leaves** (which he wears to cover his private parts).;4) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 2-2-2009(42): A **LEAF** is like a FLOWER that lasts only one GENERATION on a TREE and then it dies.;5) [[nesert](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert)] 2-11-2009(16): The _flower_ _generation_ were **leaf** smoking _tree_ -huggers.
模;imitation;Ah, but haven't modern _graveyards_ become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing **imitation** _trees_ in the _graveyard_. But of course, how convenient! They don't need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don't fall, and they remain the same color all year long.;;1) [[Elphalpo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo)] 21-1-2008(149): If I find out this furniture you're selling me is made of **imitation** _wood_ , I'll put you in the _graveyard_.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 15-1-2008(67): The Japanese are so enamored of everything plastic, they even put **IMITATION** plastic _trees_ in their _graveyards_! (No, not really, but I wouldn't be surprised).;3) [[elanlan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elanlan)] 29-12-2009(40): This kanji was a real asshole. No one liked this kanji. That is why that when this kanji died, no one cared, and it received a _wooden_ , **imitation** tombstone, not a fancy marble one, at its resting place in the _graveyard_.;4) [[peepiceek](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/peepiceek)] 14-5-2008(22): The **imitation** _tree_ looked like a _big sun flower_.;5) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 8-5-2006(21): **imitation** : we left a wodden sculpture (an **imitation** ) at the _graveyard_ of our old dog. ( **graveyard** : were we put _flowers_ for our deceased _big St. Bernard_ , good ol' _Sunny_ ).
漠;vague;Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are **vaguely** discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true _graveyard_. The _water_ may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock - anything that helps you associate **vagueness** with the _graveyard_ and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 3-8-2007(263): The precise locations of sailors who meet a WATERY GRAVE are **vague**.;2) [[jjazz_kanji_first](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jjazz_kanji_first)] 12-4-2007(147): The water in the graveyard has worn away the headstones, so the writing is **vague**.;3) [[nicjsb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nicjsb)] 6-9-2008(54): **Vague** , **vague** , watery grave. (Repeat this phrase several times).;4) [[roderik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/roderik)] 11-4-2008(26): _Water_ and _graveyard_ can only result in a **vague** mnemonic for this kanji.;5) [[akimoto](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto)] 21-6-2006(18): The mist and fog surrounding the graveyard make things appear **vague** and unfamiliar.
墓;grave;The mounds of _soil_ with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill **graves** we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the _soil_ comes UNDER the _graveyard_ , rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as "lying under boot-hill" if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji.;;1) [[simple](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/simple)] 14-9-2007(212): The _soil_ under a _graveyard_ is full of **graves**.;2) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 14-10-2007(64): A **grave** is a patch of _soil_ in a _graveyard_.;3) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 21-7-2006(28): **Grave** s are in the soil beneath the **grave** yard.;4) [[Cirion](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cirion)] 30-6-2008(21): The _flower_ s were blooming, the _sun_ was shining, when I let my St. Bernard off his leash and he lifted his leg and peed ON some freshly turned _soil_ that was dug out for a **grave**. [Thanks to dwhitman for the idea of the peeing dog because the way the last stroke for 大 is shifted rightwards would mess me up, but if the dog's got his leg up in the air… it's a nice visual image for the change from the primitive _graveyard_.).;5) [[stungunjones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stungunjones)] 23-3-2008(11): The _soil_ under the Kakariko _graveyard_ is full of many more things than **graves**.
暮;livelihood;Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a _graveyard_ and spend your _days_ tending to other's dead hood in order to make your means of **livelihood**.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(215): He made a **livelihood** out of robbing GRAVEYARDS in broad DAYlight.;2) [[Ryuujin27](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ryuujin27)] 31-12-2006(61): I like trikatu's simple way to remember this, but just in case the primitive placements confuse you, change it around to this: Before you complain about your **livelihood** , think about spending your days _under_ a graveyard. Life is always better than death, eh?;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 22-1-2008(32): The gravedigger makes his **LIVELIHOOD** digging in the _graveyard_ all _day_ For graveyard, imagine an idyllic picture: beautiful grass with the sun shining down…and a dog peeing on one of the graves. Don't confuse with [occupation](../v4/1034.html) (#1034 営). Hold onto the irony of making your LIVElyhood from tending dead people.;4) [[trikatu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trikatu)] 16-1-2007(30): Before you complain about your **livelihood** , think about spending your _days_ in a _graveyard_.;5) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 14-12-2009(11): You have to earn a **LIVELIHOOD** until you go to the GRAVEYARD, when your DAYS are over, and your SUN went down…
膜;membrane;The _part of the body_ first affected by a stroll through a haunted _graveyard_ is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word  "skin" for another kanji, and use the odd word " **membrane** " here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose **membranes**.;;1) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 25-3-2007(287): In the _moon_ light of the _graveyard_ I hear a zombie say, **MMMMM..EMM…BRANE** sssss.;2) [[calittle](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/calittle)] 5-9-2007(96): The **membrane** s in your flesh rot when placed in the graveyard.;3) [[PeterJD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PeterJD)] 6-4-2008(65): マク **Membrane** s (thin layers of connective tissue) are the _part of the body_ that decompose first (i.e., before the organs, ligaments, bones, etc.) after one dies and is buried in a _graveyard_.;4) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 4-9-2008(29): The **membrane** between the dead and the living is thinnest in a graveyard in moonlight.;5) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 28-1-2008(14): _Flesh_ eaten by zombies in the _graveyard_ is **mem~brai~ns**!!!
苗;seedling;To avoid confusion with the image of rice seedlings to appear later, we shall take these **seedlings** out of their agricultural setting in the _rice fields_ and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where  "ideas" or "values" are being implanted into _brains_ like **seedlings** to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into _flower_ right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(184): If you plant **seedling** s in a FIELD eventually they will FLOWER.;2) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 5-6-2008(61): Crap! There are _flowers_ in the _rice field_ … Who let those **seedlings** get in there?!;3) [[tanaquil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil)] 15-4-2007(43): This is obviously a flower sprouting from a rice field, and means " **rice **seedling**** " in Japanese. My problem is keeping this kanji distinct from 圥, which Heisig dubs the " **rice **seedling**** " primitive (see [land](../v4/1513.html) (#1513 陸) ff.). It might help to keep in mind that 圥 is a rare kanji (not used in Japanese) meaning "mushroom," so I will call 圥 the " **mushroom **seedling**** ".;4) [[cmayernik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cmayernik)] 25-5-2009(24): All the _flowers_ in the _field_ started as **seedlings**.;5) [[Chocobonstrife](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chocobonstrife)] 26-4-2012(16): Pikmin have FLOWERS growing out of their **seedling** BRAINS.
兆;portent;Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that **portend** coming evils.;* When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a _portent_. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a _turtle_.;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 17-9-2007(146): When your wife's _LEGs_ get huge hairs on them it is surely a bad **portent** for things to come.;2) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 13-7-2006(110): A bad **portent** makes the hairs on your legs stand.;3) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(35): Two persons turning _their backs_ is a bad **sign**. Hint: Don't use "turtle" as a primitive. You'll save a lot of troubles with following kanji if you give this primitive the meaning "a person's back".;4) [[jabberwockychortles](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jabberwockychortles)] 27-4-2009(26): The actual derivation of this Kanji is a pictograph of the cracks on a heated _turtle_ shell which was used in divination. The way the cracks occur on this _turtle_ are a **portent** of evil bad luck.;5) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 23-4-2008(9): To me it looks like a "black angel" or something (four wings and its human-looking legs). Maybe seeing it is a bad **portent**?
桃;peach tree;To associate the **peach tree** with the primitive for a _portent_ , recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the **Peach** Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant **peach** , out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named **Peach** Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also _portended_ great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the _tree_ that is associated with a _portent_ of coming evil comes to be the **peach tree**.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(92): The pits of a **peach tree** look like _turtles_.;2) [[JetSetArnett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/JetSetArnett)] 11-3-2008(80): King Koopa consistently captures Princess Peach. Eventually he's going to run out of castles and just set her in a tree.;3) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(56): If you gave the meaning "a person's back" to the primitive in [portent](../v4/235.html) (#235 兆), you can easily discover that a **peach tree** is the _tree_ with _butt_ -shaped fruits.;4) [[jettyke](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jettyke)] 16-9-2009(47): If you used the story about hairy woman´s legs for portent, then: **PEACH TREE** is the TREE that has HAIRY fruits.;5) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 11-9-2007(26): It's a little known fact, but when the ninja turtles were young Splinter actually made them follow rigid diet. Those turtles actually ate nothing but peaches. In fact, the turtles even planted a **peach tree** in their hideout not only to decorate the place with a tree, but because they were eating nothing but peaches.
眺;stare;To give someone the "evil _eye_ " is to **stare** at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being **stared** at is depicted as an _eye_ that _portends_ evil.;;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 11-1-2006(140): Sauron's One fiery eye **stare** at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 13-11-2007(62): People **stare** d, _eyes_ wide, at the girl in the bathing suit - she had extremely _hairy legs_!;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 13-11-2007(54): You lost a **staring** contest with a _turtle_ because you blinked your _eye_ before he did. (The contest wasn't fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don't need to blink so often.) _Eye_ comes first, because **stare** is most associated with eyes. And compare with [challenge](../v4/658.html) (#658 挑) where this same obstreperous turtle _challenges_ you to a finger wrestling contest. (Sibyl's story with some notes that helped me).;4) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(31): If you gave the sense "a person's back" to the primitive in [portent](../v4/235.html) (#235 兆), you can easily discover an old-man _staring_ at a good-looking girl: he doesn't apart his _eyes_ from her _back_.;5) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 2-3-2008(27): Litterally this kanji reads " _eye_ of _portent_ ". Imagine an old lady **starring** into the crystal sphere trying to _portend_ the future.
犬;dog;We know that the character for _large_ takes on the meaning of the _St. Bernard_ **dog** when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The _drop_ added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized **dog** , which compared to the _St. Bernard_ is no more than a _drop_ in the kennel.;* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a _chihuahua_ for convenience sake). When it takes the form 犭 to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of _a pack of wild dogs_.;1) [[LucidFaia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia)] 9-4-2008(76): A large **dog** , dripping drool.;2) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 24-3-2008(17): If we remember [large](../v4/107.html) (#107 大) as a man with his arms outstretched, the **drop** represents man's best friend - a **dog**.;3) [[basch2020](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/basch2020)] 6-9-2009(13): An average **dog** is made to look like a little drop next to a St Bernard.;4) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(11): A LARGE ST. BERNARD **DOG** with a DROP of saliva.;5) [[cryonic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cryonic)] 2-1-2012(9): I don't know why not one single person before me has seemingly thought of this, but when I first encountered this character, it just seemed SO natural for me. It looks just exactly like a guy throwing a stick for his **DOG** to bring it back to him. Or am I really the only one seeing this picture?
状;status quo;Did you ever hear of the _turtle_ who fell madly in love with a _chihuahua_ but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the **status quo** with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love.;;1) [[tomtosh](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomtosh)] 31-7-2007(161): It was _left_ to the **turtle** to make _right_ with the **dog** and thus maintain the **status quo.**.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 13-12-2006(91): A _turtle_ mounting a _chihuahua_ clearly disrupts the **status quo**.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 4-12-2007(43): After beating the hare in a race, the _turtle_ is now acknowledged to be the fastest animal. But the chihuahua is challenging the **status quo** , demanding a new race. And look - the dog is on the right, meaning he's passed the turtle! Hope he doesn't take a nap.;4) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(35): If you gave the sense "a person's back" to the primitive in [portent](../v4/235.html) (#235 兆), you can see that a _dog_ , wanting to preserve its **status quo** among its pals, tries to bite the _back_ of a poor postman.;5) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 27-1-2009(28): The **STATUS QUO** was broken when the TURTLE and the DOG got married! You should have see the offspring… Dogs with shells on!!
黙;silence;Oddly enough, the character for **silence** shows us a _black chihuahua_. Actually, the cute little critter's name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about **silence** that begins,  "Hello, Darkness, my old friend...." Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character.;;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 25-10-2006(366): The _computer_ won't stop beeping, which is making the _chihauhua_ bark, and it's driving this guy insane. The only solution he can come up with is to throw them both on the _fire_ and finally enjoy the **silence**.;2) [[Wakela](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wakela)] 23-3-2007(56): Your neighbor is so sick of you playing Led Zeppelin that he takes your copy of the song Black Dog and burns it. Finally, **silence** in the neighborhood.;3) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 28-11-2007(45): A scene of calm SILENC: You're typing away on your COMPUTER, while your pet DOG lies beside, a nice FIRE warms you both. No noise to disturb the **SILENCE**.;4) [[kalamies](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kalamies)] 30-7-2006(34): **Silence** is a paramount for any _black_ ninja _dog_.;5) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 29-3-2009(27): HINT: this is NOT black and dog. It is computer, dog and fire. So my risque but memorable story is: sitting at the naked at the _computer_ watching _doggystyle_ porn with a _fire_ to keep me warm. It suddenly gets louder and I have to hit the mute, or **silence** button so as not to disturb the neighbours… Apologies for the rudeness, but was having trouble remembering and this made it stick.
然;sort of thing;The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality, hence we refer to it as " **sort of thing**. " Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (See frame 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an _oven flame_ with the _flesh_ of a _chihuahua_ being thrown into the whole concoction to make it into a  "hot- diggity, dog-diggity" **sort of thing**.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 11-10-2007(322): _Flesh_ of a _dog_ over a cooking fire = "hotdog". There are all **sorts of things** in _hot dogs_. Believe me, you don't want to know what **sort of things** . Visualize the hotdog curling as it cooks, to remember the unusual way the flesh primitive curves in this kanji. (tweaked version of ziggr's. Thanks!).;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 9-9-2006(98): There are all **sorts of things** in _hot dogs_. (I use _hot dog_ for this primitive ( _meat_ of a _dog_ over a _cooking fire_ ). I swear I can actually see the 月 here as a hot dog, with its slight curve and grill marks.).;3) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 16-10-2007(39): Putting the _flesh_ of a _dog_ on a _fire_ is the **sort of thing** that will get you arrested.;4) [[vxnine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vxnine)] 21-9-2008(22): Imagine the _flesh_ of a _dog_ roasting OVER a fire. Gross. I'd never want to eat that **sort of thing**.;5) [[Sonofswin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sonofswin)] 2-2-2009(18): The _moon_ in the _evening_ is the **sort of thing** that makes a _dog_ howl as if _on fire_.
荻;reed;You've no doubt seen cattails, those swamp **reeds** with a furry _flower_ to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome _pack of wild dogs_ : lure them into a swamp of these **reeds** with the cattail _flowers_ and then set _fire_ to the swamp. Take care to focus on the _flower_ rather than the  "cattail" to avoid confusion with frame 259 below.;;1) [[sannomiya](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya)] 22-2-2007(218): **REED** S are the only FLOWERS that WILD DOGS like to FIRE up and smoke while they are playing poker.;2) [[sindhikara](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara)] 30-6-2008(137): A **reed** is a flower that looks like a hot dog.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 8-10-2007(50): Picture a Gary Larson cartoon of a pack of _dogs_ sitting around a _campfire_. They misunderstood something they overheard, and can't understand why they're not getting high smoking **reed**. In the kanji, you can actually see the dog smoking the **reed** in a crack pipe held over the fire. (Thanks, chamcham!).;4) [[snagger](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snagger)] 9-7-2008(34): **Reed** s: the only flowers that can survive fire and dogs.;5) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 20-9-2009(14): _pack of dogs_ hanging out by the _fire_ smoking _reed_ _flowers_.
狩;hunt;One of the worst problems you have to face when you go **hunting** is to _guard_ your take from the _wild dogs_. If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding.;;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 27-3-2007(186): Actually when **hunting** it may be a good idea to use a _pack of dogs_ as your personal _guard_.;2) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 1-4-2008(85): After a _pack of wild dogs_ **hunt** some food, they will _guard_ it fiercely.;3) [[tstuhldreher](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tstuhldreher)] 7-7-2008(69): In every prison escape movie, the **hunt** for the escapees involves a pack of WILD DOGS unleashed by the GUARDS.;4) [[samesong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samesong)] 30-6-2008(9): In Duck **Hunt** , that _dog_ is damned lucky the game _protects_ him, or I'd shot him by now.;5) [[matt_jenkins](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins)] 18-3-2008(8): Imagine: you sit in the porch of your _house_ , rub your pack of _wild dogs_ vigorously with _glue_ and send them off to **HUNT** rabbits by rolling on them and returning with the poor little critters _glued_ to them. Supposedly, the Russians trained dogs with mines on their backs to run under German tanks in WWII, so the idea is feasible.
猫;cat;Knowing how much dogs love to chase **cats** , picture a _pack of wild dogs_ planting  " **cat** - _seedlings_ ," watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of **cats** for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a  "crop of **cats** ," you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago.;;1) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 31-7-2007(169): The **cat** hid in the FLOWERS of the FIELD from the WILD DOGs.;2) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 15-6-2009(98): Dawgs always wanna put their seedlings in pussies.;3) [[Kvaien](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kvaien)] 29-5-2009(27): It looks like a **cat**. The flowers are the ears, the field is the face, and the dog is the tail.;4) [[srothroc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/srothroc)] 28-2-2010(16): Packs of wild dogs will chase a **cat** through flowers and fields.;5) [[jezerey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jezerey)] 11-2-2008(11): The crafty **cat** hid from the pack of dogs among the seedlings.
牛;cow;Can you the "doodle" of a **cow** that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs.;* As a primitive, the same sense of _cow_ is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off. In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.;1) [[Georgi87](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87)] 1-4-2008(210): A **cow** tried to climb up a vermilion tree, but in doing so, it broke its two bottom branches off.;2) [[dannyfartmaxwell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dannyfartmaxwell)] 6-5-2009(44): Mooooooooooooooooooo!!!!;3) [[LoneDeranger](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LoneDeranger)] 4-3-2009(25): A **cow** bleeds _vermilion_ when you cut off two of it's legs.;4) [[vosmiura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vosmiura)] 29-8-2006(9): No matter how many times you roll over the **cow** with a steam-roller, it will still be two strokes short of looking as vivid red as _vermillion_ pigment.;5) [[Silwing](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Silwing)] 15-12-2009(6): This is a **cow** … **Cow** \- How you say? Imagine a **cow** which has just been run over by a steamroller. Now you see, the head to one side, four legs and the tail backwards. Yes that is indeed a **cow**.
特;special;Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word **special** distinct from the character we met earlier for _specialty_ (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a **special** class all its own - like the sacred _cows_ of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the _cows_ should be placed on the sacred grounds of a _Buddhist temple_ in this kanji.;;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-10-2007(200): Think of not **special** people, but **special** animals. The sacred Hindu _cows_ are **special** \- they can wander around the _temple_ without fear of becoming roast beef.;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(45): The Church Lady is traveling through Japan and notices with distaste a sacred _cow_ relieving itself inside a _Buddhist Temple_. "Well, isn't _that_ **special** ".;3) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 31-3-2008(31): _Cow_ s at a _Buddhist temple_ are **special** \- they are holy cows! Sadly a few days later I find the same _cow_ s' meat on **special** at the supermarket. Holy Cow, what have we done!?;4) [[Dualta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Dualta)] 22-4-2008(21): **Cows** are **special** when _left_ **in temples**.;5) [[thegreatkaizo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegreatkaizo)] 22-7-2008(16): Mixing up Hinduism and Buddhism, the _cow_ ended up as today's **special** at the _Buddhist temple_.
告;revelation;Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts **revelation** through the _mouth_ of a _cow_ , suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence.;;1) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 18-9-2007(412): The **revelation** makes the cow's mouth drop down, "Hamburgers are made of what?!".;2) [[Ningen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ningen)] 6-9-2008(29): In ancient times, the words from a _primitive cow's mouth_ were considered a **REVELATION** because they were the "udder truth.".;3) [[Christine_Tham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christine_Tham)] 18-8-2007(23): When you get a **revelation** , you may _drop_ to the _ground_ with your _mouth_ wide open.;4) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 20-9-2008(17): Ask an enlightened Zen monk for a single word of **revelation** , then go and ask any cow for the same thing. You"ll probably get the same answer– "Muuuuu!" Spiritual **revelation** coming out of the mouth of a cow.;5) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 5-10-2007(16): The **revelation** makes the _cow_ 's _mouth_ drop open. "Hamburgers are made of _what_?" Think of a Gary Larson cartoon. (Slight tweak of pageturner's).
先;before;Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a _cow_ with _human legs_ , as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a _cow_ -suit. I always thought I'd prefer to be the one standing **before** , rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the "butt" of everyone's laughter.;;1) [[gaijinda](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gaijinda)] 20-10-2007(232): I've never seen a _cow_ with _human legs_ **before**!;2) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 9-6-2008(158): Nasty story but it keeps the meaning true to the kanji. "BEFORE you stick it in a COW and SPREAD the legs (the bottom stroke of this cow looks like two legs) make sure she has HUMAN LEGS"————-sorry, I'll remove if I get enough reports, but will keep if I get more stars.;3) [[LorenPaul](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LorenPaul)] 28-7-2009(67): **Before** Human Beings Existed.. Minotaurs Ruled The Earth! Their Top Half A Cow And Their Bottom Half Human Legs! Also: Using Minotaur as a primitive can make stories a doddle!;4) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 8-12-2007(65): I've never seen a cow with human legs **before**! (from gaijinda) I keep mixing this up with [in front](../v4/290.html) (#290 前). Remember that **before** sounds like "beef or", so it must be the one with the cow in it.;5) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 7-12-2007(30): Note: If you are confusing "before" 先 with "in front" 前 , then note that "before" sounds like " **beef** or", so that must be the one with the _cow_ in it.
洗;wash;This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: _water_ . . . _before_. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once. Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called  "Pigpen," who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him " **Wash** -Out." Everywhere he walks, a spray of _water_ goes _before_ him to sanitize everything he touches.;;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 10-2-2008(286): In Japan, you always **wash** with _water_ from the shower _before_ you enter the bathtub.;2) [[undershaft](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/undershaft)] 27-2-2007(80): You **wash** things with WATER to get them back to the clean state they were in BEFORE.;3) [[stephjapan2004](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stephjapan2004)] 25-10-2007(41): **WASH** with WATER BEFORE doing anything.;4) [[mcbainpc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc)] 25-6-2008(29): You need _water_ _before_ you can **wash**.;5) [[Melamelachan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Melamelachan)] 3-8-2007(16): In 1525, the city of Salzburg was occupied. Legend has it that there was nothing left to eat, except for one _cow_. To trick the occupying forces, people would paint the cow, and send a human (with _human legs_ ) and the _cow_ out for a walk, clearly visible to the enemies. Then, they would use some _water_ to **wash** the _cow_ and paint it with a different colour and so on. Seeing there were still plenty of _cows_ left, the occupiers finally gave up. The people of Salzburg are still called _cow_ - **wash** ers.
介;jammed in;The idea of something getting **jammed into** something else is depicted here by having a _walking stick_ get **jammed into** an _umbrella_ frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the _umbrella_ stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved umbrella handle, and on the right the straight _walking stick_. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant.;;1) [[LucidFaia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LucidFaia)] 9-4-2008(194): The two strokes at the bottom look like a J and I, which stands for "jammed in.".;2) [[alkulp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alkulp)] 29-10-2007(63): Two people **jammed in** under an **umbrella**. A woman with a dress and a man (straight). It's always me that ends up getting wet…. but the tail of the skirt is this time!;3) [[Yozora](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yozora)] 19-5-2009(55): J and I are "Jammed Into" an UMBRELLA.;4) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 18-10-2007(13): The _beach umbrella_ is **jammed in** to the sand using _two poles_ instead of one, so it's extra steady. I was a little rough though so I accidentally bent one of them.;5) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 9-6-2008(12): 介する 【かいする】 (vs-s,vt) (1) (See を介して ) to use as an intermediary, to mediate, to assist, (2) to worry, to mind, to care. STORY: It's raining out and you are arguing with your bf/gf about why they didn't bring their own UMBRELLA. Now the two of you are **JAMMED IN** under one (J and I just how lucidfaia said). Then imagine another person who forgot their UMBRELLA JAMMES IN with you and offers to MEDIATE your argument in exchange for protection from the rain.
界;world;As the **world** gets _jammed_ with more and more people, there is less and less space. Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a **world** so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the _rice fields_ ). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being **jammed into** that already narrow space.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 22-8-2007(116): One Japanese farmer I know is so small minded that he thinks the entire **world** is JAMMED IN the borders of his little RICE FIELD.;2) [[eltjopoort](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eltjopoort)] 12-5-2008(93): A famous philosopher once said that his **world** consisted of all the things he could _jam into_ his _brain_.;3) [[tharvey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey)] 9-2-2009(51): If you fit everyone in the **world** into a _rice field_ , they would be pretty _jammed in_.;4) [[tsenita](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tsenita)] 18-5-2009(22): The **world** is just one big ol' RICE FIELD with billions of people JAMMED IN.;5) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 12-3-2009(15): This is a pictograph of a MISS **WORLD**. She was the only contestant with a BRAIN, and the curved stroke is her bent leg (think curtsy) or her sweeping elegant dress.
茶;tea;As everyone knows, **tea** is made from **tea** leaves. But the **tea** plant itself has its own _flowers_ , which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the _tea_ , as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of _flowering_ **tea** bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g _wooden poles_ (Frame 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny _umbrella_ at the top to shade the delicate-tasting **tea** _flowers_.;;1) [[wreckz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz)] 21-1-2008(214): Some people think drinking **tea** is boring and quaint. That's why I spice mine up by adding a cocktail umbrella, which of course is made from a _wood_ -en toothpick supporting a paper _umbrella_ with _flowers_ printed on top.;2) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 13-9-2007(92): When I drink _herbal_ **tea** I like to drink it under a _parasol_.

脊;spinal column;The **spinal column** has sprouted out of the _flesh_ of your back into an _umbrella_ that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the  "ribs" of the _umbrella_. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (Frame 24).;;1) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 8-5-2007(71): "Look", says the teacher in biology class. "The **spinal column** holds your _flesh_ together, just like the metal rod of this _umbrella_ (he demonstrates this with an umbrella covered in _I-Ching_ symbols) holds the umbrella together".;2) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 27-4-2009(31): A pictograph of a **spinal column**. The _umbrella_ representing the shoulder blades, the _I Ching_ as the shoulder muscles and the _part of the body_ as the spine itself.;3) [[FutureBlues](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FutureBlues)] 6-10-2008(10): The **spinal column** functions in the same way the rod does in an _umbrella_ … To hold one's _umbrella of flesh_ together, much like the _I Ching_ does for the universe.;4) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 21-7-2009(8): In a horrific accident, a _body part_ got _jammed in_ the _grill_ of my car: a **spinal column**!;5) [[timcampbell](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/timcampbell)] 28-1-2008(6): When my Korean girlfriend (from the I CHING symbols on the Korean flag) stands under an UMBRELLA and stretches her BODY, you can see the outline of her **spinal column**.
合;fit;The kanji for **fit** reads literally, top to bottom, as a _meeting_ of _mouths_  \- which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people's ideas don't **fit**  with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what would happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose _mouths_ didn't **fit**.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 13-9-2007(159): I wouldn't mind a _meeting_ of _mouths_ with her, she's really **fit** !;2) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 13-7-2007(102): He had such a big _mouth_ that he could easily **fit** _one_ whole _umbrella_ in it.;3) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 23-4-2008(47): _Meeting_ of _mouths_!

(If you don't believe me try to **fit** two and see how they will get wet.).
塔;pagoda;On the left we see a mound of _dirt_ , and to the right _flowers_ made to _fit_ together. The two sides combine to create a great **pagoda** made of _dirt_ , with _flowers_ by the tens of thousands _fitted_ together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and _fit_ a few of the _flowers_ in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force.;;1) [[nilfisq](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nilfisq)] 14-8-2007(165): In order to build a **pagoda** in this small Japanese garden everything has to _fit_ : the _soil_ to the left and the _flowers_ in the upper right corner.;2) [[xeyes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/xeyes)] 21-5-2007(48): Pictograph- o-rama. This is a corner of a Japanese garden, with a small mound of _soil_ on the left, and a little concrete **pagoda** in the front with _flowers_ behind it. (To my eye, the _fit_ looks a lot like a little **pagoda** anyway. This may or may not cause confusion for you, though…).;3) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 13-7-2007(39): The _ground_ next to the **pagoda** could barely _fit_ all the _flowers_ the empress wanted planted.;4) [[anthropic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic)] 7-7-2008(34): Thankfully I was in a **pagoda** when I, ummm, _soil_ ed myself, the _flowers_ covered up the smell and the mess _fit_ out one of the holes in the side while no one was watching…;5) [[Yasser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser)] 9-11-2008(23): A **pagoda** is a place of harmony in Japan. This means that even the "soil" where "flowers" are planted must "fit" together (good for remembering the order of writing).
王;king;See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a **king's** scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with the basic element for _I beam_ and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in.;* As a primitive, this can mean either _king_ or _scepter_ , but it will usually be taken to mean _ball,_  as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame.;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 13-9-2007(141): To be **king** you have to be a real _crafty one_ !;2) [[negreality](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/negreality)] 27-5-2010(102): A **King** is one（ 一 ） who rules over the land （ 土 soil）.;3) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 2-4-2008(33): The **king** unites heaven and earth.

玉;jewel;Note the _drop_ here in the king's _scepter_ , which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious **jewel** handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power.;* As a primitive, we can use this to mean either _jewel_ or _ball_. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame.;1) [[Ramchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip)] 24-4-2007(200): The king is said to have only one family **jewel** below the belt…;2) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 20-1-2008(36): The king is said to have only one family **jewel** below the belt…and he hangs left! (I always screw up the direction of the "drop").;3) [[indiana23](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indiana23)] 28-12-2009(35): I can tell you that there is only one thing that Japanese people think when they see this Kanji, and that's BALLS(no joke). Kintama, or gold balls, means testicles. Funny story, we met a European girl not to long ago who had this as a tattoo, and she thought it actually meant **JEWEL**. But as I said, the Japanese guys wanted to know why she liked BALLS so much. lol (True Story).;4) [[daredawg3583](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/daredawg3583)] 7-12-2007(15): Only Kings can poop **jewel** s.;5) [[RobMow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RobMow)] 30-6-2009(13): King dropped his pants to reveal his **jewel**.
宝;treasure;Every _house_ has its **treasure** , as every thief knows only too well. While the things we **treasure** most are usually of sentimental value, we take the original sense of the term **treasure** here and make it refer to _jewels_ kept in one's _house_.;;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 7-11-2007(99): On **treasure** island is a single _house_ \- where all the _jewels_ are stored.;2) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 23-4-2008(84): Put a " _roof_ " (lid) on your _jewels_ and voila! You've got a **treasure** chest.;3) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 30-3-2008(50): I have **treasure** : _jewels_ which I hide in my _house_.;4) [[noushina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/noushina)] 14-1-2007(21): If Wealth and Savings aren't confusing enough, we now add **Treasure**.

珠;pearl;Take care to keep the meaning of this kanji distinct from that for _jewel_. Think of the most enormous **pearl** you have ever seen, a great _vermilion_ -colored _ball_ sitting on your ring and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing.;;1) [[Christoph](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph)] 18-4-2007(191): The king of the Oysters produces special Vermillion **pearl** s!;2) [[quety101](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/quety101)] 25-1-2008(79): King Vermillion is a little queer and likes to wear **pearl** necklaces.;3) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 19-1-2008(58): Usually **pearls** are white, or black. Only a very rare, very expensive **pearl** is _vermillion_ colored.

Thanks ngoli1).;5) [[anthropic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic)] 10-7-2008(23): I gave the princess a **pearl** necklace and the [king](../v4/255.html) (#255 王) turned a bright shade of [vermilion](../v4/221.html) (#221 朱) when he saw it on her.
現;present;Do not think of a "gift" here, but of the **present** moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a _ball_ in which we see the **present**  \- obviously a crystal _ball_ that enables us to _see_ things going on at the **present** in faraway places.;;1) [[mimiko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mimiko)] 20-8-2007(176): _The KING_ … can _SEE_ clearly the **PRESENT** state of affairs in the land. (maybe he hees them in the crystal ball on the left?).;2) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 4-1-2008(67): Hey, I want my money back! This crystal _ball_ is out of order, I can _see_ the **present** instead of the future!;3) [[lmcrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lmcrtk)] 10-4-2009(37): Many people claim that Elvis (The KING) has been SEEN walking around in the **PRESENT**.;4) [[lucianreign](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign)] 6-12-2006(28): The king came…the king saw…thus, the king was **present**.;5) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 29-10-2007(18): The palintir shows only what's happening NOW - the **present** \- to the all- _see_ ing eye of Sauron. Unfortunate overlap of keywords. I sometimes write 贈 [presents](../v4/503.html) (#503 贈) when given this keyword for review.
玩;toy;If, at some aboriginal level, **Toys** Я Us, then the archetypal _ball_ must have been there at the _beginning_ , before evolving into beach balls, ping- pong balls, rugby balls, and marbles.;;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 14-11-2006(53): The _ball_ was the only thing that people at the _beginning_ of time had to use as a **toy**. Poor cavemen.;2) [[koohiikun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun)] 18-9-2010(37): Even the _king_ played with **toy** s in the _beginning_.;3) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 23-8-2009(25): And so it was, the _ball_ marked the _beginning_ of all the **toys** that were to come.;4) [[gfb345](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gfb345)] 7-5-2010(9): 玩 depicts one of the most ancient **TOY** s known to mankind: _MARBLES_. The use of such small _BALL_ s for play goes back to the _BEGINNING_ of recorded history. ( **TOY** _MARBLES_ were found in Egyptian pyramids, for example.).;5) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 20-3-2007(4): Mnemonic " **toy** boy" - From the days of the garden of eden boys have used their _balls_ as **toy** s.
狂;lunatic;A **lunatic** is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the  " **looneys** " are the legendary lycanthropes or "wolfmen." Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going **looney** and setting himself up as _king_ of a _pack of wild dogs_ that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 13-9-2007(201): Oh no ! A _pack of dogs_ has bitten the _king_. He has turned into a rabid **lunatic** !;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 19-11-2006(32): Think of _King_ Nebuchadnezzar, who for 7 years **lost his sanity** and had to live like a _wild animal_.;3) [[Jaunty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Jaunty)] 13-6-2009(27): The _wild dog king_ (Red XIII) had an awesome limit break - **Lunatic** High!;4) [[jonobugs](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jonobugs)] 3-5-2008(19): Only a **lunatic** would use a _wild pack of dogs_ to protect the _king_.;5) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 5-2-2010(16): The _Dog king_ was a **lunatic**. In fact, he was a laughing hyena. Use the **lunatic** hyena(dog) in the Lion _King_ if it helps.
旺;effulgent;The radiant, **effulgent** splendor of he _sun_ makes it _king_ of all the planets and other stars. Just to be sure you don't take this too abstractly, picture the _sun_ seated on a throne, flourishing its _scepter_ this way and that.;;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 7-6-2007(60): The _Sun King_ (Louis XIV) was known for his **effulgent** reign.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 2-8-2008(19): [+katsuo] This is the _Sun King_. Sayeth Wikipedia: "The _Sun King_ (in French le Roi Soleil) because of the idea that, just as the planets revolve around the _Sun_ , so too should France and the court revolve around [the _king_ ] ("<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV_of_France>). And just like the _sun_ , he was quite **effulgent** and actually emitted _sun_ light.;3) [[Woodsei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Woodsei)] 10-3-2012(13): The _sun_ is the **effulgent** _king_ of stars.;4) [[montecristo73](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/montecristo73)] 17-6-2010(7): The sun is the king of **effulgent** bodies in the sky.;5) [[amillerchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip)] 4-1-2012(4): Eeffulgent? I'll never remember that. Renaming this **full of vigor**. The _king_ always started the _day_ **full of vigor** , ready to rule his kingdom like the nobles of old.
皇;emperor;An **emperor** , as we all know, is a ruler - something like a _king_ but higher in status. The _white bird_ perched above the _king_ , elevating him to **imperial** heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that _white birds_ have long done in folklore throughout the world.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 4-10-2007(151): Ancient Rome had **Emperor** s instead of Kings, and they wore white robes. Thus an **emperor** is a _king_ in _white_. (make sure you picture a roman **emperor** not a japanese one and you'll be ok).;2) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 13-10-2008(63): I don't think the Japanese would be happy if their **emperor** was a _white king_ …;3) [[lucianreign](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lucianreign)] 6-12-2006(50): The white dove descended on the king and he was promoted to **emperor**.;4) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 14-7-2006(24): An **emperor** is a holy king.

He is the _king_ of all the _white_ stormtroopers.
呈;display;The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: "Wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the _king_? " If we think of **display** in terms of that famous line, and the _king_ with his head thrown back and his _mouth_ wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position.;;1) [[Georgi87](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87)] 5-9-2007(157): The mouth of the king is **display** ing his bling.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 21-10-2007(131): What a pathetic **display**!

全;whole;**Wholeness** suggests physical and spiritual health,  "having your act together." The kanji-image for **wholeness** depicts being  " _king_ under your own _umbrella_ ," that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word **whole**?;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 18-10-2007(168): The fat _king_ hogs the **whole** space under his _umbrella_. (tweaked version of radical tyro's story. "fat" makes a more vivid image for me.).;2) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 20-12-2005(121): The _king_ takes up the **whole** space under his _umbrella_.;3) [[mhheie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mhheie)] 4-4-2008(69): King Arthur united the **whole** of England under his umbrella. (The umbrella methophore works pretty good here, due to England's miserable weather).;4) [[baldy514](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/baldy514)] 3-1-2009(17): You need a king sized umbrella to keep your **whole** body dry.;5) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 4-6-2006(10): This is similar to radical_tyro's story, but has a few points that help me. Whenever it rains, the _king_ hogs the **whole** _umbrella,_ and we can't do anything about it (because, after all, he is the _king_ ).
栓;plug;Here we think of **plug** in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: _tree_ . . . _umbrella_ . . . _ball_. Imagine a _tree_ with a faucet in the side out of which tennis _balls_ are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach _umbrella_ into the _tree_ to **plug** it up.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 12-10-2007(155): The fat _king_ under his _umbrella_ offers useless advice to the workers. "You'll need the _whole_ _tree_ to **plug** that gap". Imagine a grossly fat, incompetent king under a parasol giving annoying advice to sweating workers who know what they're doing.

This story reminds me how to build that part. ).;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 12-11-2007(92): To **plug** the hole, you need to use a _whole_ piece of _wood_ \- like a cork or something.;3) [[wreckz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wreckz)] 22-2-2008(75): Best example of a **plug** is a cork.

Ouch.;5) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 24-4-2010(28): To **plug** the hole in the dam, use the **whole** damn **tree**.
理;logic;We first referred to this character back in frame 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of **logic** we are given is something like a central _jewel_ in a _computer_ , like the _jewels_ in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the rams and roms and approaching this shining _jewel_ , a chorus of voice sand a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all- knowing **logic**.;;1) [[Birdsong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Birdsong)] 26-4-2007(341): The king of **LOGIC** is the computer.;2) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 16-7-2006(33): Computers are ruled by **logic** (it is the king of computers).;3) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-12-2007(29): If you used the meaning "House of the Parents" for [ri](../v4/173.html) (#173 里), you will know then that, as **logic** dictates, the _King_ must rule on his own Kingdom (the _House of his Parents_ ).;4) [[fjolnir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fjolnir)] 29-10-2009(17): The _king_ of **logic** is the _computer_!;5) [[eri401](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401)] 16-2-2009(12): **LOGIC** reigns _king_ at my _parent's house_ = no bullshitting my wise mom or dad with silly stories!
主;lord;A man's home is his castle, goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was **lord** of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or _drop_ ) of a _king_ in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to  "read off" the primitives in this way, you won't end up putting the _drop_ down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel.;* As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass _candlestick_ (with the drop representing the flame at the top).;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-10-2007(196): A **lord** is a little _drop_ down from _King_ in hierarchy.;2) [[Spoonz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz)] 15-2-2009(79): A **lord** only has a drop of the king's power.;3) [[Murjab](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Murjab)] 20-9-2007(28): Although this kanji's meaning hasn't caused me much trouble, I've had problems remembering the direction of the _drop_ above _king_ , since _drops_ at tops of kanji often seem to appear in different directions. To remember this one, I think of the placement of the _drop_ in _jewel_ (#256 玉). Both of them use the _king_ primitive and include a short _drop_ stroke going from the top left to bottom right.;4) [[trevlaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/trevlaw)] 8-11-2008(23): Oh **lord**! someone spat on the king.;5) [[MidoriTori](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MidoriTori)] 7-8-2009(10): The **lord** wants to DROP something on the KING'S head so he can become king himself.
注;pour;Picture **pouring** water from a lighted _candlestick_. What could be more ridiculous, or simpler, as a way to recall this kanji?;;1) [[gsantise](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise)] 1-9-2007(120): Visualize an idiot trying to figure out how to extinguish a candle. He sees a glass of WATER and decides to **pour** it onto the CANDLESTICK to put it out. Water spills everywhere.;2) [[Calchas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Calchas)] 20-12-2007(65): Like water the hot wax **pour** ed down the side of the candlestick.;3) [[pgp27](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pgp27)] 14-6-2009(57): "WATER, my LORD ? I'll **pour** ".;4) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 4-10-2007(40): When you **pour** you are the _water lord_.;5) [[Guoguodi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Guoguodi)] 10-1-2008(27): The lord always **pour** s for the king.
柱;pillar;The **pillar** referred to here is the _wooden_ beam that stands at the entrance to a traditional Japanese house. Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic _candlestick_ and your work is done.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 9-10-2007(216): The main **pillar** in a house should be made of the biggest and strongest tree - the _lord_ of the _trees_.;2) [[potempkin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin)] 30-9-2008(79): "Why has this **pillar** been carved in the shape of a giant penis?!"

金;gold;If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of **gold** bullion with an _umbrella_ overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the _scepters_ of the kingdom, _drop_ by _drop_ , and shaping them into bars.;* As a primitive, it means not only _gold_ but any _metal_ at all.;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 22-10-2007(173): The fat _king_ taking up the _whole_ space under the _umbrella_ actually isn't fat - he just has two big **gold** bars hidden under his clothes.;2) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 31-1-2008(39): Under the _umbrella's_ shade, the king sang, " _Drop_ it to the left, _drop_ it to the right, give me all the **GOLD** in sight!".;3) [[stefanot](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stefanot)] 11-11-2006(25): The [king](../v4/255.html) (#255 王) walks under the _umbrella_ with a bag of **gold** on both side.;4) [[namakemono](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/namakemono)] 13-10-2009(21): _King_ Midas shelters from the rain under his _umbrella_. Every now and again he reaches out with his hands to turn a couple of rain _drops_ into **gold** , and puts them in his pockets.;5) [[hugh2323](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hugh2323)] 22-5-2010(5): Give me two DROPS of **gold** and I will give you my WHOLE body.
銑;pig iron;**Pig iron** refers to iron in the crude form in which it emerges from the smelting furnaces. Of all the various forms _metal_ can take, this one shows us _metal_ _before_ it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled  " _before_ " and "after" to show the process.;;1) [[wzafran](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wzafran)] 16-6-2007(174): **Pig iron** is basic/crude _metal_ , that is, _before_ it has been processed.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 7-7-2008(121): **Pig- iron** is crude _metal_ ( 金 ) _before_ ( 先 ) it is refined. If you have trouble with this character, envision a big minotaur ( _cow_ head with _human legs_ ) as a blacksmith, smelting metals and making swords for war.;3) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 17-9-2007(33): 100% of Japanese university graduates claim to have never seen this character, so impress them by remembering it, **Pig-iron** is metal _before_ it has been processed. (Just a copy of the most common used story but with this little fact added, really impress your japanese friends or teachers by learning this one).;4) [[uchifly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uchifly)] 27-5-2009(8): **PIG- IRON** is the condition of IRON BEFORE it has been processed.;5) [[Lazerbeat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lazerbeat)] 17-8-2011(5): GOLD BEFORE an alchemist touches it is pig iron.
鉢;bowl;Let **bowl** suggest a large and heavy _golden_ **bowl** into which you are throwing all the _books_ you own to mash them into pulp, for some outrageous reason you will have to think up yourself.;;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 17-6-2008(202): This is the **BOWL** of an alchemist: see how he mixes _metals_ in his **bowl** , as he follows the instructions from his _book_?;2) [[sannomiya](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya)] 20-11-2006(66): If I was begging with a **BOWL** , I would want GOLD and BOOKS.;3) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 31-3-2008(27): I actually picture a _book_ made of _gold_ that's been warped (due to the malleability of gold) so that it has a dent in the middle that can be used as a **bowl**.;4) [[skinnyneo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skinnyneo)] 13-8-2007(23): This is a great way to learn a lot of knowledge in a little bit of time. You get a _metal_ **bowl** and throw in as many _books_ as you can! Keep'em coming! Once you have every book you can think of that you have read or want to read in that **bowl** grind'em all up!;5) [[applesuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki)] 13-12-2006(21): The winners of the super **bowl** get _gold_ rings, while the losers just get a mention in the record _book_.
銅;copper;Picture an order of _monks_ serving as chaplains for the police force. Their special habit, made of protective _metal_ , is distinguished by a row of **copper** buttons just like the  " **cops** " they serve.;;1) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 2-3-2008(350): I can't believe no one has used this one yet: **Copper** is _metal_ which looks almost _the same_ as _gold_. Really, look it up on Wikipedia, it's yellow and it's shiny (atleast in some compounds)!;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 4-6-2006(51): **Copper** is an excellent conductor. In other words, it's a _metal_ for which the voltage is the _same_ everywhere. That's why it's used for wires.;3) [[sethg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethg)] 29-1-2009(22): A _metal_ that looks the _same_ as _gold_ is **COPPER**.;4) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 13-11-2007(14): **Copper** and _gold_ are in the _same_ column of the periodic table. And now what am I going to do for 銀 [silver](../v4/1459.html) (#1459 銀)????;5) [[Sevenhelmets](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Sevenhelmets)] 27-7-2008(10): **Copper** is a metal, the _same_ as _gold_.
釣;angling;The character we learned for _fishing_ (Frame 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the **angling** of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your **angling** rod is a _golden_ _ladle_ which you are using to scoop _gold_ fish out of a river.;;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(152): All the people that go to the Japanese festivals to catch fish part time are suckers. Me? I'm a pro. I bring a big-ass **golden** **ladle**. I'm a true **ANGLING** professional.;2) [[mcbainpc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc)] 25-6-2008(90): The easiest **angling** is pulling _gold_ fish out with a big _ladle_.;3) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 17-10-2007(56): Imagine an effeminate Roman 2000 years ago **angling** with a _golden ladle_ instead of a rod because it matches his eyes and hair better and it impresses the boys. (Why a Roman? Because 'angling' is just the roman-derived way to say 'fishing' - use this to distinguish fishing from **angling**.).;4) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 18-8-2006(27): **Angling** is not fishing (avoid [fishing](../v4/172.html) (#172 漁)). It is the art of bending _golden ladles_ into lures which which you catch the fish. But the fish aren't that important (and do not appear in this kanji). only the _golden ladle_ matters.;5) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 17-9-2007(14): I use a _gold_ _ladle_ when I'm **angling** , the golden reflection in the water draws the fish straight to it, who needs a hook and bait when you have this!
針;needle;In frame 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for _needle_ (on the right) derives. Since we already expect that **needles** are made of _metal_ , let us picture a set of solid _gold_ darning **needles** to complete the kanji.;;1) [[gsantise](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gsantise)] 26-8-2007(149): Remember the story of the **needle** in the haystack. Why would someone even look for a **needle** if it wasn't a GOLD **NEEDLE**?;2) [[sprutnik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sprutnik)] 28-10-2008(80): A _golden_ **needle** is worth _ten_ times more than an ordinary **needle**.;3) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 12-9-2007(24): The golden **needle** is the true **needle**.;4) [[dtstutz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dtstutz)] 28-1-2008(15): **Needle** s need to be metal (or they'll break).;5) [[Spoonz](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spoonz)] 15-2-2009(11): Final fantasy reference! If you've been petrified by one of those damned monsters, get a team mate to use a golden **needle** on you!
銘;inscription;Take **inscription** in the sense of the _name_ you ask the jeweler to carve on a _gold_ bracelet or inside a _gold_ ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 27-9-2007(194): A piece of _metal_ with a _name_ on it. Well, this is basically the definition of **inscription**.;2) [[NooNoo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NooNoo)] 28-4-2008(35): I imagine ancient Egyptian **inscription** s: Pharaohs' _names_ written in _gold_.;3) [[elmaestrokgb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/elmaestrokgb)] 23-5-2009(17): The _gold_ ring I gave her had an old girlfriend's _name_ written inside. Here's hoping she doesn't notice the **inscription**.;4) [[sannomiya](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sannomiya)] 17-4-2007(8): **INSCRIPTION** S are done on GOLD plaques by writing your NAME on it.;5) [[skellyfish](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/skellyfish)] 15-12-2008(7): If you've got some METAL and you want to put a NAME on it, you've got no choice but to use an **inscription** \- everything else will rub off or fail to stick in the first place. (Imagine a bunch of people trying to write on metal with pencils, pens, etc. and then one guy with a Eureka moment thinking of **inscription** ).
鎮;tranquillize;The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of _metal_ to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating subconscious reactions when the _truth_ was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that **tranquillize** them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 11-10-2007(157): **Tranquilize** \- using a _metal_ syringe to get the _truth_.;2) [[tomusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan)] 17-2-2008(114): Enough _gold_ can **tranquilize** the _truth_ in anyone.;3) [[adrianbarritt](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adrianbarritt)] 22-7-2008(68): James Bond was **tranquilize** d by **Gold** finger before trying to get the **truth** out of him. Picture James Bond waking up on the table with the laser.;4) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 6-6-2008(62): No need to **tranquilize** … enough _gold_ will get the _truth_ out of anyone.;5) [[viphe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/viphe)] 31-10-2006(50): To **tranquilize** your wife, you give her either _gold_ or the _truth_.
道;road-way;The key word carries both the sense of a **road** for transit and a **way** or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the _neck_ of a _road_. Think of a crowded **road-way** where traffic has come to a standstill - what we commonly refer to as a  "bottle _neck_. ";;1) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 5-2-2008(198): When we go out on the **ROAD-WAY** , we often risk our own _necks_ (that's why I take the train! ).;2) [[whistler11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11)] 19-12-2005(39): Watch as a villianous fiend stretches a poor damsel's _neck_ over a dusty _road_. Her ear pressed to the ground, she can hear the rumble of a carriage thundering down the roadway. Will the hero save her in time? Or will her _neck_ be ground into the _road_ , spilling it's precious contents into the dust?;3) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 7-7-2008(30): Good keyword selection by Heisig: while the primitive on the left means _road_ , the whole kanji also has the meaning of **way** , or 'tao (teaching)'. Thus, road + way. (Check out the wikipedia article on the Chinese Philosophical concept of "Tao": <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao>. It's this character!).;4) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 3-3-2008(26): I have a very abstract view for this one. Remember when the kanji for [neck](../v4/70.html) (#70 首) was first introduced to us it was compared to a great moose head, cut off by it's _neck_ and hung on the wall? As we all know, mooses have very long _necks_ , if you imagine widening and stretching it a little you'll probably be able to picture yourself taking a stroll on the hairy ' _neck_ - ** _road_ -way**' of the moose. It's a very abstract mnemonic, but I swear, I was not high when coming up with it!;5) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 22-1-2008(13): You're going to break your _neck_ on the **road way**!
導;guidance;When we accept someone's **guidance** , we permit ourselves to be _glued_ to a certain _road_ or _way_ of doing something, and try to  "stick" to it.;;1) [[jez321](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jez321)] 27-2-2006(263): For **guidance** on the _road-way_ , _glue_ a GPS unit to your car.;2) [[cosby](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cosby)] 19-7-2008(112): Good **guidance** will help you stay _glued_ to the right _path_.;3) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 22-8-2007(38): I will glue myself to this roadway before I go to an all **guy dance** (guy dance = **guidance** :P ).;4) [[astgtciv](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv)] 5-1-2007(25): In his quest, our hero comes to a river of _glue_ that he cannot cross. Desperate, he prays for **guidance** , and a _roadway_ magically appears _over_ the _glue_.;5) [[alatown](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/alatown)] 19-9-2009(14): His **guidance** was simple: don't risk your neck, just stay glued to this road- way.
辻;crossing;Take the first two strokes in the sense we gave them back in frame 10, as the pictograph of a _cross_ , and set it on a _road_ to create a  " **crossing**. ";;1) [[aevangelica](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aevangelica)] 18-7-2007(152): Cross-road.;2) [[tanaquil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil)] 28-4-2007(57): This kanji appears in the remarkable compound, 辻斬り 【つじぎり】 (n): killing a passerby in order to test a new sword. Imagine a _cross_ by the _road_ , at a busy **crossing** , marking the spot of the unfortunate passerby's death.;3) [[plumage](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/plumage)] 4-8-2008(43): A **crossing** is where the ROAD makes a CROSS with another road. Easy.;4) [[vinniram](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vinniram)] 10-12-2009(29): Why is there an extra drop on this website, but in the book there is no extra drop?;5) [[hotkiller123](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotkiller123)] 18-1-2009(13): _Cross_ - _road_ – > **CROSSING** The extra drop is a _drop of blood_ on the road because of the many accidents that happen there. (Addition to aevangelica's story to explain the extra drop.).
迅;swift;Here we see a _crossing_ in the form of a barbed _fishhook_ , suggesting a **swifter** alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the  "cloverleaf" design used on superhighways in the United States.;;1) [[jezerey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jezerey)] 11-2-2008(219): The car went too **swift** ly through the crossing and was hooked by the cops.;2) [[mbagsh55](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mbagsh55)] 13-9-2007(74): In the Heisig version of Frogger, you can image _ten_ giant _fish hooks_ sweeping across the _road_ , with our hapless hero 'froggy' forced to make a **swift** crossing or end up as fish bait.;3) [[KANJI](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KANJI)] 10-10-2006(37): Indy Jones imperative: Be **SWIFT** at the **CROSSING** or you'll be **HOOKED**. (How many times have we seen Indy Jones defy death. But is he so quick and nimble to conquer the travails on the road through RTK?).;4) [[joxn_costello](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello)] 21-11-2008(36): If you spread _fishguts_ all over a _crossing_ , people will definitely want to cross over it very **swiftly** to get away from the awful smell!;5) [[cellophane](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cellophane)] 5-12-2007(25): You cannot simply walk across a busy _crossing_ \- you must be far **swift** er than that to avoid being squished by the traffic. Instead, you need a piece of Link's gear - a _fish-hook_ -shot, to grab onto a railing on the other side and pull you across in time.
造;create;Think of **creating** as making something out of nothing. Then recall how the _way_ of _revelation_ laid out in the Bible begins with the story of how God **created** the world out of a dark and chaotic nothingness.;;1) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 23-12-2007(284): A _cow_ **creates** a _road_ by _eating_ all the grass on its _path_.;2) [[saleem](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saleem)] 23-3-2008(151): CREATION is the ROAD to REVELATION (if you're feeling artsy) :).;3) [[krungthep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/krungthep)] 25-4-2008(124): Creationist say that the universe was **create** d as it is now.

迫;urge;To **urge** someone to do something, you make the _way_ as appealing as possible, perhaps even _white_ washing it a bit.;;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 13-10-2006(179): When you have the **URGE** to go to _White_ Castle, you know it's time to hit the _road_.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(106): When you start down the **road** of **cocaine** , you're sure to feel some pretty bad **URGE** s soon.;3) [[graham6565](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/graham6565)] 26-10-2006(91): White lines on the road are there to **urge** you to stay on the correct side of the street.;4) [[applesuki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/applesuki)] 17-12-2006(42): If you have a unrelenting **urge** to pee while on the _highway_ , you have to cross the _white_ line and pull off into the breakdown lane.;5) [[ouroborosatx](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ouroborosatx)] 31-5-2008(33): The two paths one can take in life are the _white_ _road_ and the dark road. I **urge** you to take the _white_ _road_.
逃;escape;When **escaping** from something or someone, one always feels as if one is not going fast enough, like a _turtle_ on an expressway. (Since the _turtle_ is on the _road_ and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in frame 250.);;1) [[Georgi87](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Georgi87)] 3-4-2008(93): I used my pants to make a rope, which I then used to **escape** from prison, hence the naked, hairy legs running along the road!;2) [[atomiton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/atomiton)] 1-3-2010(64): MARIO KART: When you're blasting down the **road** in Mario Kart, it's REALLY hard to **escape** from **turtle shells**.

Adopting Georgi87: I used my pants to make a rope, which I used then to **escape** from prison, which is why you can see _my back_ while I run along the _road_!
辺;environs;To keep the **environs** clean and safe, you could cement _daggers_  in the _road_ , blades pointed upwards, so that no polluting traffic could pass by. You could, if you were an ecologically-minded terrorist.;;1) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 18-4-2007(205): Caution: this kanji doesn't mean environment, it means "environs, boundary, border, vicinity".

Stand there wagging your finger: "This is my house!".;5) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 27-11-2007(6): Protect the **environs** by patrolling the _road_ with your _dagger_. I tend to mistakenly put the abbreviated version of the sword primitive in this kanji.
巡;patrol;A virtual  _flood_ of motorcycle police washing down a _road_ is this kanji's image for a **patrol**.;;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-8-2007(134): The cops don't **PATROL** anymore - they just **flood** the **road**.;2) [[diracbracket](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket)] 16-11-2007(71): The Venice cops **patrol** on river roads.;3) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 11-6-2008(47): Crime has increased so the police have been recruiting PACMAN's to **PATROL** the STREETS.

車;car;You may keep the whole range of connotations for this keyword, **car** , provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them.;* _Car_ , _cart_ , _wagon_ , and _vehicle_ may all be used as primitive meanings.;1) [[Twentytw0](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Twentytw0)] 19-7-2007(151): My **car** is so fast it can go through ten rice fields in ten minutes.;2) [[saranich](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/saranich)] 20-1-2006(17): Actually, this is a 10x10 **car** that can get you through a rice field.;3) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 23-12-2007(15): Rather than hobbling along with a _walking stick_ to cross through a _span_ , it's much better to use a **car**.

Also, it's important to include the word "through," so you know the _walking stick_ goes right THROUGH the _span_.;4) [[hotsw4p](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hotsw4p)] 21-12-2009(12): The travelling _time span_ is _cut in half_ if going by **car**. / The **car** allows you to _cut your travelling time span by half_.;5) [[nycity](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nycity)] 2-5-2007(8): My **car** cost me the equivalent of 10 rice fields .. 10!!
連;take along;What you are meant to **take along** in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the _car_ on the _road_ should ground your image for picking up your friends to _take_ them _along_ to wherever you are going.;;1) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 16-9-2007(161): When you put your _car_ on the _road_ you should always **take along** a few friends. Don't confuse with [carry](../v4/303.html) (#303 運).;2) [[Ji_suss](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ji_suss)] 24-8-2008(31): This kanji also means "linked" or "series" so I've changed the kanji meaning to "GO ALONG (WITH EACH OTHER)." Well, a ROAD and a CAR certainly GO ALONG with each other. And the CAR will help you to GO ALONG the ROAD. This Kanji is the "Union" in Soviet Union and the "United" of United Nations (the countries that "go along with each other" at least some of the time).;3) [[Lizzie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Lizzie)] 24-5-2008(30): When I am on the road I always **take along** my car.;4) [[eri401](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eri401)] 29-6-2009(20): The difference between [transport](../v4/289.html) (#289 輸), [take along](../v4/287.html) (#287 連) and [carry](../v4/303.html) (#303 運)? **Transport 輸** = when your car moves big items, like meat and sabers for that one butcher's hut. **Take Along 連** = when you take a guest in your car on the road. **Carry 運** = the luck you carry when the king's carriage is out on the road, tossing gold coins to bystanders.;5) [[Mesqueeb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Mesqueeb)] 5-12-2008(9): [Borat] I want **take along** many garls in _pussymagnet_ (= _car_ ) on my _road_ back to Kazakstan.
軌;rut;Combine the primary and secondary meanings of this keyword to form your story. Begin with the _car_ whose tires get caught in a **rut** and spin without going anywhere. Then go onto the _baseball team_ who can't win a game because it has fallen into a **rut** of losing.;;1) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-10-2007(262): My _car_ got so stuck in a **rut** it required _nine_ people pushing to get it out again.;2) [[Verdana](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Verdana)] 24-2-2009(47): My _car_ got so stuck in a **rut** it required _a baseball team_ pushing to get it out again.;3) [[ceeeps](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ceeeps)] 16-9-2007(38): I got my _car_ stuck in a **rut** !

Nein! Nein! Nein! Nein!!!!…" Also, the Kanji is made up of NINE strokes.
輸;transport;On the left we see a _vehicle_ used for **transport**. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for _meeting_. Below it we see the elements for _flesh_ and _saber_ , which combine to create a compound element for a _butcher_ and his trade. Together they give us the image of a  "trucker's convoy.";;1) [[jmadsen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmadsen)] 17-12-2005(219): The _car_ is a cattle-car, used to **transport** animals for the _butcher_ 's _meeting_ \- a convention on new butchering techniques.

喩;metaphor;People who try to sound literary often end up butchering the language. Here we see a _meeting_ of _butchers_ whose _mouths_ are producing the **metaphors**.;;1) [[Themistoclaus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Themistoclaus)] 24-4-2011(51): **Metaphor** ically speaking, all the equipment in your _mouth_ is basically just a _meeting of butchers_ , designed to pulverize whatever meat you put in there.;2) [[Elphalpo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Elphalpo)] 16-7-2010(18): **Metaphor** : A good **metaphor** flows from the _mouth_ like the _meeting of flesh and saber_ , smoothly piercing the listener with its meaning. But a bad **metaphor** is like when you barely nick the _flesh_ and only spill _two drops_ of blood or when your _saber_ doesn't penetrate at all but rather bends into a くく shape when you whack the _flesh_. (Note: This story incorporates both the traditional form of the kanji ( [口＋兪](midori://search?text=口＋兪) ) and the simplified form ( [口＋俞](midori://search?text=口＋俞) )) .;3) [[thecite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite)] 24-11-2009(13): **Metaphor** : (Let this altered butcher primitive = _koo-koo butcher_ , notice the kana くく). _Koo-koo butcher_ s sell even the _mouth_ of an animal and support their actions with crappy **metaphors** such as "I ain't never meat the man who doesn't like his mouth.".;4) [[aaroncp](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aaroncp)] 6-2-2011(11): A _meeting of butchers_ is a perfect **metaphor** for the supposed secret talks( _mouth_ ) between Hitler and Stalin.;5) [[kapalama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama)] 7-11-2011(3): 喩え ( 例え ), 比喩 , 隠喩 , 暗喩 , 直喩 , [metaphor](../v4/3009.html) (#3009 喩) ユ( 輸 ), たとえる, たとえ … Parts: 口 , 兪/俞 (cf: 輸入 [transport](../v4/289.html) (#289 輸), 真鍮 [Unicode-0x936e](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/37742) (#37742 鍮)) … Story: A **Meat-aphor** for modern times: What we put into our _mouths_ , the dead flesh from a thousand _Koo-Koo Butchers_ , is the cause of the that which comes out of those same mouths. We speak of nothing but death from our mouths, because we put nothing but death into our mouths.
前;in front;We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the _butcher_ hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram's _horns_ placed **in front** of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for _before_ (Frame 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.;;1) [[diracbracket](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/diracbracket)] 26-12-2007(354): When I get _horn_ y my _flesh sword_ sticks out **in front** of me.;2) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-10-2007(74): If you stand **in front** of a bull's _horns_ , you are asking for your _flesh_ to be _cut_ (or _butchered_ if you prefer).;3) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 23-2-2007(63): **IN FRONT** of the BUTCHER shop, there is a sign made of HORNS.;4) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 19-1-2008(21): At the bullfight, the matador stands bravely **in front** of the bull's _horns_.

各;each;"Suum cuique" goes the popular Latin proverb. A certain disease of the English language makes it almost impossible to translate the phrase without gender bias. In any event, here we see someone walking with his/her _mouth_ between his/her _walking legs_ , giving us an image of "To **each** his/her own. ";* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive, otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word "every," which we shall meet later in another context.;1) [[penne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/penne)] 16-3-2008(260): Son, I've never told you this but **each** woman has a second _mouth_ between their fiiiiiine _walking legs_.;2) [[johanvg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johanvg)] 18-7-2006(156): **Each** and every one of us walks and talks differently.;3) [[miki76](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miki76)] 15-12-2008(87): **Each** person is gifted with a _mouth_ to get us into trouble and a pair of _walking legs_ to get us out!;4) [[Zareon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon)] 12-2-2007(67): It's easier for me to remember a concrete object. This combination occurs often enough for me to make it a primitive element. Walking legs and mouth combine to give a "walky talky" or mobile phone. Imagine one of those old big ones which looked like refridgerators. Mobile phones are so popular that **each** of us seems to want one.;5) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 6-2-2008(39): **EACH** of us learns first to use our _legs to walk_ and then to use our _mouths_ to talk.
格;status;If you can imagine _trees_ as **status** symbols (as they might well be for those living in Japan's congested cities, where greenery has become something of a luxury item), then _each_ might be aiming to have his/her own _tree_ , just to keep up with the Suzukis.;;1) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 13-6-2007(250): "Ranger! I want you to go check the **status** of each tree." "Errr, Each tree sir?" replies the ranger looking out over the vast forest. "That's Right, I want the **status** of each tree! Move out!".;2) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 22-10-2010(80): A man measures his own **status** by the size of his _wood_ y…and compares it to _each_ one he sees. 性格 (せいかく) : character, personality, 合格 (ごうかく) : success, passing (e.g. exam), eligibility.;3) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 11-12-2007(73): I find I need a more concrete image for this. EACH TREE has it's own **STATUS**.

Unless you are Kumi KOUda and can actually afford to buy lots of trees, the only way you will get them is if you KAKU them.
賂;graft;To those who believe in the inevitability of **graft** in government, everything has a price - or as this character has it, to _each_ office its outlay of _shells_.;;1) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 16-7-2007(68): It might sound simple to bribe someone, but then you have to **graft** the guy above him and the guy below him, and soon you're just giving _shells_ to _each_ and everyone!;2) [[cameron_en](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en)] 28-11-2008(18): When I was caught by the police doing some **graft** (graffiti), I gave _each_ cop some _clams_ and told them to be on their way. 賄賂 【わいろ】 bribe.;3) [[hunchbag](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag)] 7-9-2011(10): _Graft: the acquisition of money, gain, or advantage by dishonest, unfair, or illegal means, especially through the abuse of one's position or influence in politics, business, etc. ._ _STORY:_ The evil corporate extortionist **graft** s all who get within his power. He **GRAFT** s a different amount of MONEY from EACH of his victims. If they have more, he extorts more. He even plots it out on an evil graph!;4) [[doviende](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/doviende)] 23-10-2011(6): **Graft** is like bribing. You have to give _MONEY_ to _EACH_ person. There's a guy with a briefcase full of money and a walky-talky, and he's going around asking on the walky-talky about who he should give money too. "This guy gets money? Roger.".;5) [[blannk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blannk)] 30-10-2009(5): I take this to mean the verb **graft** , and so simply see a bunch of shellfish being **grafted** onto _each_ other, _each_ to _each_.
略;abbreviation;_Each field_ has its own **abbreviations** (chemistry, philosophy, sports, etc.). Needless to say, the  "stronger" primitive - thatis to say, the simpler and more often used one - takes the dominant position on the left, even though the story would read them off the other way around.;;1) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 26-4-2008(200): There are so many **abbreviation** s and acronyms nowadays that no _brain_ can remember _each_ of them.

額;forehead;As Miss Manners will be the first to tell you, out of respect, one does not look straight into the eyes of one's _guests_ , but focus on the top button of their collar.

夏;summer;In the **summer** , fatigued by the heat, your _head_ hangs down nearly as far as your _walking legs_ , or rather, your "dragging legs." Note how the _walking legs_ (instead of  "animal legs") are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for _page_ (Frame 64).;;1) [[Birdsong](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Birdsong)] 8-5-2007(172): In **SUMMER** you are hot from the top of your _head_ down to your _walking legs_.;2) [[rachels](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rachels)] 28-7-2008(114): _One_ _drop_ of sweat runs into my _eye_ , when I go _walking_ on a hot **summer** day.;3) [[ouroborosatx](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ouroborosatx)] 27-5-2008(94): I personally think it was too confusing to try and use _head_ as the primitive. (How am I supposed to remember that the _animal legs_ are replaced with _walking legs_ instead of _human legs_?) Rather, I think have the image of a hot **summer** and you want to keep _oneself_ under a _ceiling_ not out _jogging_ around.;4) [[kapalama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama)] 15-8-2011(33): Tip:Don't use Head/Page( 頁 ) as a primitive, or it will just screw up. 頁 is used hundreds of times as primitive, and _always_ needs the animal legs. Repetition makes RTK work. Little changes make life hard … The smell of sweat in **Summer** rises to the _ceiling_ , leading you to take your 自 _nose_ out on 夂 _walking legs_ for fresh cool air. Remember a set with 冬 [winter](../v4/427.html) (#427 冬) where the sweat ( _two drops_ in fact), has fallen down and frozen below those same _walking legs_.;5) [[whistler11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11)] 22-4-2006(14): The heat of **summer** is so powerful, it swells your _head_ so big, you need a bigger set of _walking legs_ to hold it up.
処;dispose;Both the stretching out of the _walking legs_ and the little bit of _wind_ tucked in on the right suggest using one's legs to kick something out of the way, or **dispose** of it.;;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 16-5-2007(278): The best way to **dispose** of a nasty bit of wind is to let it go and use those walking legs to dissapear. Nobody will ever know it was you.;2) [[anthropic](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anthropic)] 12-7-2008(146): To **dispose** of rubbish you should _walk_ it to the bin not throw it to the _wind_.;3) [[misha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha)] 11-7-2007(65): Contrast this with [discard](../v4/655.html) (#655 捨). Disposing of something implies a degree of care, whereas discarding something is generally careless. You want to associate this with a careful way to get rid of something. You throw a piece of garbage into the _wind_ to get rid of it, but remember that you should **dispose** of it responsibly and your walking legs carry you off to fetch it.;4) [[Pete171](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pete171)] 23-9-2008(28): To **dispose** of something you can either kick it away with your _walking legs_ or you can wait for the _wind_ to blow it away.;5) [[NyahK](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NyahK)] 2-1-2010(12): I thought to **dispose** of my _wind_ secretly, but it appears I 'left' a trail behind whilst _walking_ away.
条;twig;Geppetto made _walking legs_ for his little Pinocchio from two **twigs** of a _tree_ , giving him a set of " **twiggy** " shanks.;;1) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 28-1-2008(586): They all say they have a _TREE_ between their _WALKING LEGS_ but most only have a **TWIG**.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 8-11-2007(103): Don't confuse with branch or bough - think of snapping **twig** s. A **twig** is always the kind of _wood_ that snaps when the hunter's _walking legs_ just barely touch it, making a snapping sound that alerts the prey to the hunter's presence.;3) [[romanrozhok](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/romanrozhok)] 11-6-2008(50): I don't believe this means **twig** as in a tree **twig**. 条 【じょう】 (n) (1) article (in document), provision, (2) stripe, streak, line. STORY: If TREES had WALKING LEGS they would march right up to congress and demand they put in a new ARTICLE into the constitution against deforestation.;4) [[tharvey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tharvey)] 13-11-2009(24): (Doesn't mean **twig**!) I read an **article** in the Weekly World News about a _walking_ _tree_.;5) [[wasurenaide](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide)] 8-5-2007(14): I once read an **ARTICLE** about a guy who shoved a **TREE** between his _WALKING LEGS_. he was pulling out **TWIG** s for a long time.
落;fall;When _water_ **falls** , it splats and splashes, when _flower_ petals **fall** , they float gently in the breeze. To _each_ thing its own way of **falling**.;;1) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 18-9-2007(184): Water each flower or the petals will wither and **fall**.;2) [[pm215](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pm215)] 15-2-2008(120): [It's been suggested on the forum (<http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.php?id=1079>) that _flower_ across the full width of the kanji and _water_ on the left below it should have its own keyword, _seaweed_ is a popular choice. See also [dilute](../v4/227.html) (#227 薄), [clan](../v4/1912.html) (#1912 藩), [seaweed](../v4/2035.html) (#2035 藻). This story is for the benefit of those using that idea.] Picture a group of Japanese skydivers **fall** ing through the sky – suddenly _each_ one opens, instead of a parachute, an enormous sheet of nori _seaweed_ to carry them safely down.;3) [[Yasser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser)] 20-11-2008(75): "Flowers" need "water" "each" day or they'll bend and **fall** over (helps with the order of writing).;4) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 9-4-2007(25): The _flowers_ **FALL** over the _water each_ hanami season.;5) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 12-11-2008(13): "each" is impossible to visualize, instead I picture a guy **fall** ing down with his mouth open in a scream and his walking legs above him flailing as he's **fall** ing. Works well for this kanji if you imagine him **fall** ing from a waterfall. At first he's holding on to some flowers, but they finally give and he tumbles into the water below.
冗;superfluous;Picture a _weather vane_ beneath a regal _crown_ , spinning round and round. It is not only **superfluous** but makes a perfect ass out of the one who wears it.;;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 14-1-2006(418): The king's crown was blown off by the wind. "Oh well," he said, "it's just a **superfluous** symbol.".;2) [[emanalo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/emanalo)] 6-7-2008(51): The court jester wears a _crown_ and is full of _wind_ with bad jokes. He is **superfluous** to the King's court. This kanji is read as "JOU" and commonly used to create the compound for _jou-dan_ 冗談 (jest or joke) hence court jester. Also _jou-go_ 冗語 (redundancy) and _jou-in_ 冗員 (useless workers) 員 -[employee](../v4/56.html) (#56 員).;3) [[tanaquil](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tanaquil)] 23-4-2007(28): Trying to put a _crown_ on the _wind_ is like gilding the lily: entirely **superfluous**.;4) [[Ninjasha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ninjasha)] 12-2-2008(17): The _wind_ bags who wear the _crown_ are almost always **SUPERFLUOUS** to the governance of their countries.;5) [[TadghD](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TadghD)] 30-6-2009(10): Instead of just fluous, like the flow of the wind, I crown you **superfluous**.
冥;Hades;The key word in this frame refers to the underworld, the world of the dead. By way of the classic Greek association, it is also used for the "dwarf planet" Pluto. Since no one knows precisely when this part of the cosmos was finished, we may imagine it as the _crowning_ deed of _day six_ of the creation.;;1) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 2-11-2007(68): The beast of **hades** one _day_ will wear a _crown_ , and the number of the beast is _666_.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 30-7-2009(45): In **Hades** you have to work _six days_ a week before _crowning_ it with something vaguely resembling a weekend. Oh wait, that's Japan.;3) [[cb4960](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cb4960)] 16-2-2009(21): In **Hades** , as punishment, souls are forced to wear _crowns_ as hot as the _sun_ for _6_ 66 days.;4) [[Neobeo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo)] 21-2-2009(7): If you can survive **Hades** for _six days_ they give you a _crown_ as a reward.;5) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 18-7-2007(7): It's dark in **Hades** , for the _sun_ is covered by a _crown_. Oh, yeah, and the number _six_ is just a wee bit popular down there.
軍;army;The _crowned vehicle_ depicted here is a  " _chariot_ ," symbol of an **army**.;* Used as a primitive this kanji means only _chariot_.;1) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 19-1-2008(150): British **army** _cars_ are at the service of the _crown_.;2) [[RickN](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RickN)] 11-12-2007(45): Imagine a _crown_ is the hood ornament on every **army** _car_.;3) [[Cirion](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Cirion)] 23-7-2008(31): The **army** has _cars_ that are under the command of the _crown_ \- in ancient days these would have been _chariots_. (NB: "under" to help remember placement of the primitives.).;4) [[joxn_costello](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/joxn_costello)] 23-11-2008(17): A _vehicle_ _crowned_ with a turret is a tank – and obviously a tank belongs in the **army**!;5) [[yukkuri_kame](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yukkuri_kame)] 24-8-2008(7): There is an **army** of taxi drivers in Japan driving the Toyota Crown model of car.
輝;radiance;Take advantage of the first syllable of the key word to think of the _ray_ of light to the left. Now add the glittering _chariot_ that is emitting those _rays_ and you have **radiance**.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 29-10-2007(197): Rays of light emitted from Apollo's chariot = **radiance**. Don't put the sun into this kanji. The rays are coming from the chariot directly!;2) [[erlog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erlog)] 18-7-2008(134): **Radiance** is an army of rays.;3) [[anroo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/anroo)] 25-7-2009(59): **Radiance** isn't just a few _rays_ , but a whole _army_ of them.;4) [[sethimayne](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sethimayne)] 25-10-2007(30): When I think of **radiance** I think of the greek god Zeus - picture him throwing _rays_ of lightning (hence the extra jaggedness of the character) from atop his _chariot_ riding through the heavens.;5) [[brendanmacdonald](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/brendanmacdonald)] 21-4-2008(13): Ray's little legs joined the army - so Ray-did-a-dance (radiance).
運;carry;A long string of "sweet" _chariots_ "swinging low" to our _roads_ is a sure sign that the Lord is  "comin' for to **carry** " someone home.;;1) [[javiergakusei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei)] 27-3-2007(245): Don’t confuse it with “take along” (287). In that one, there was a car so you could take along your friends once you found them on the road.

Well now the king is saying "i should have had the thing GLUED to my head from the BEGINNING".
夢;dream;To have a **dream** after going to bed is really the _crown_ to a perfect _evening_. The _flower_ petals over the _eyes_ (instead of the  "sand" that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant **dream** suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji.;;1) [[mameha1977](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mameha1977)] 13-11-2007(164): Last night's date with Miss Sweden was like a **dream**.

So we can make a little poem: _Flowers_ over your _eyes_ , The _crown_ of a perfect _evening_.;5) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 18-10-2006(30): I like to think of the sideways eye as a _cyclops_ , either the monster of Greek mythology or the X-Men character. The primitive reappears in [demolition](../v4/400.html) (#400 壊) and others. So: Odysseus and his mates carefully hang magical _flowers_ above the evil _cyclops_. These allow them to take the monster's _crown_ and escape in the _evening_ , while the monster is peacefully **dreaming**.

He uses a _whirlwind_. (and for the primitive:) A **whirlwind** is made by a magician from his _top hat_ , he holds it up and a ferocious _wind_ whirls out of it, messing up the attire of everyone in the front row. _[RTK2 #221, pure group, コウ. signal primitive_ whirlwind _is コウ because you will get コウght in it unless you are at the very コウ=core]_.
高;tall;Recalling an image from frame 195, first see the _mouth_ under the extraterrestrial's glass _hood_ , and then the _mouth_ under the _top hat_ of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling's headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much **taller** than everyone else.;* As a primitive, this character keeps its sense of _tall_ and its position at the top of other primitives, but its writing is abbreviated to the first 5 strokes.;1) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 30-11-2007(149): Two little aliens in a trenchcoat and _top hat_ , trying to look **TALL**.

(adjusted for clarity).;4) [[Alunalun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alunalun)] 14-5-2009(19): This is the classic two children trying to be **tall** enough to get on a fairground ride. The lower child hides under a _cover_ while the upper child stands on his shoulders and talks like he's an adult. But they're still not **tall** enough! So the top child gets a _top hat_ which j-u-s-t pokes above the 'you must be this **tall** ' line. (and they both have hungry _mouths_ for eating candyfloss once the deception is complete).;5) [[Yasser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Yasser)] 19-11-2008(12): A cowboy (here represented by a "top hat" revealing only his "mouth") looks always **tall** against a ninja wrapped up in his "hood" that reveals only his "mouth".
享;receive;_Tall children_ **receive** more attention. _Tall children_ grow up to make better wide **receivers**. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football. At any rate, be sure you have some particular _tall child_ in mind, someone who really was outstanding and always attracting attention, because he or she will come in handy in the next two frames.;;1) [[Ramchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip)] 22-1-2007(138): In basketball however, tall children **receive** all the attention.;2) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 30-11-2007(87): _Tall children_ **receive** all the attention.

This time its a small CHILD whimpering under the figure on the floor, scared of what is to come.;4) [[Chaze](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Chaze)] 11-5-2010(21): A word of warning: With Heisig's story I keep associating this with "attention"! I use something closer tied to the word **receive** : Imagine a bunch of kids finding an old radio. It's antenna is broken, so the _tallest_ _kid_ has to hold it up, and becomes the designated **receiver**.;5) [[cefreddffo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cefreddffo)] 15-10-2009(13): Usually in yaoi couples the short guy is the one who "receives".

塾;cram school;**Cram schools** are after-hours educational institutions where kids can do concentrated preparing for their coming entrance examinations or drill what they missed during regular class hours. The exception are the _tall children_ who are out on the school _grounds_ practicing sports, and the _fat_ ones who are out there burning off calories.

周;circumference;Look more closely at your _lidded crock_ and you will see little ruler marks along its bottom edge.

士;gentleman;The shape of this kanji, slightly differing from that for _soil_ by virtue of its shorter final stroke, hints at a broad-shouldered, slender-waisted warrior standing at attention.

Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that **study** is one thing and _learning_ quite another again. In the kanji, too, the character for _learning  _(Frame 616) has nothing to do with the _schoolhouse_.;;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 12-1-2007(78): In the _school house_ there are _kids_ always **studying**.

牧;breed;When it is time to **breed** new cattle, the bull is usually willing but the _cow_ is often not.

訓;instruction;The personalism connoted by the word **instruction** , as opposed to "teaching" or "discipline," suits the picture here of _words_ guiding one's progress like the gentle flowing of a _stream_.

詩;poem;Since silence is treasured so highly at a _Buddhist temple_ the _words_ spoken there must be well-chosen. Perhaps this is why the records of the monks often read to us like **poems**.

止;stop;The character for **stop** is easiest to learn as a pictograph, though you have to take a moment to see it.

政;politics;To the many definitions for **politics** that already exist, this character offers yet another: _correct taskmastering_. Think about what the primitives tell us. On the one hand, we see the pessimistic wisdom that **politics** has to do with _taskmastering_ , maneuvering people with or without their will.

定;determine;**Determination** , in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to _mending_ one's _house_.;;1) [[jrothenberg](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jrothenberg)] 31-1-2007(231): In The Karate Kid, the boy must prove his determination by MENDING his teacher's HOUSE in various ways.;2) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 25-1-2007(88): Prior to buying a home, the _home_ inspector will come into your house and **determine** everything that needs _mending_.;3) [[hanako1975](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hanako1975)] 14-1-2008(50): People who decide to renovate (ooh, that's a fancy word, let's say _"mend"_ ) their _houses_ must be very **determine** d DIYers.

New primitive meaning: CORRECT PERSON: Do you see the 4th and 5th stroke? They look like the kanji for "person." Therefore, CORRECT + PERSON = CORRECT PERSON. STORY: I DECIDED/DETERMINED I would fix my HOUSE this summer but am still looking for the CORRECT PERSON to do it (i.e. a contractor).;5) [[davcarruth](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/davcarruth)] 7-5-2009(25): The Determinator Arnold Schwarzenegger has **determined** to get out the ladder and the tools and start _mending_ the _roof._ "I'll be back - after mending the roof," he utters dramatically.

走;run;**Running** , we are told here, _mends_ the _soil_.

The difference is that this kanji talks about **surpass** ing or crossing over a mountain (or the like) while 385 is used when **surpass** ing or transcending a amount of money, an expectation, etc. STORY: Some punk kids dared one of their friends to PASS/SURPASS the PARADE.

衣;garment;At the top we see the _top hat_ , and at the bottom a pictographic representation of the folds of a **garment**. If you break the  "4-fold" fold into 2 sets of 2 strokes, you will find it easier to remember.;* Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of _cloak_ or _scarf_ will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here. When it appears to the left, it looks like a hiragana ne (ネ) with an extra drop on the right, and we shall take it to mean _cloak_.  At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the _top hat_ ) are omitted, which we shall take to mean a _scarf_. On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitive, in which cases we shall speak of a _top hat and scarf_. And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of _garment_ in general. Note that when any of the above forms have something beneath them (as in frame 429), the third from final stroke is  "unhooked.";1) [[indigo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/indigo)] 18-1-2008(133): The only **garment** s allowed in this club are _top hat_ and _scarf_.;2) [[jackhuddleston](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston)] 19-4-2008(82): The **garment** s most commonly associated with the _craft_ of a magician are the _top hat_ and the _magic wand_.

Of course, the " _number 1_ " _mountain_ in Japan is _Mt._ Fuji. The bottom half, under _Mt._ Fuji, consists of _crown_ and _towel_. Now for the story. Archaeologists digging under _Mt._ Fuji (Japan's _#1_ _mountain_ ) in an ancient royal tomb (they know it's royal because of the _crown_ ) discover what looks like a _towel_ , but after they clean it up, they see it is actually a splendid royal _sash_ for the king's kimono.;2) [[LazyNomad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad)] 28-3-2009(160): WARNING: Try to avoid thinking of the upper element as a combination of _one_ and _mountain_ , because in this case you will get used to the incorrect stroke order.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 15-10-2007(56): Beautiful "Miss Housewife Japan" is on posters everywhere, cooking right before Mt. Fuji (the _number one_ _mountain_ ) while wearing nothing but her crown, and an _apron_ tied with a **sash**.

(Note that according to the dictionary, breaking down this Kanji includes only the radicals for "walking stick", "one", "crown" and "towel". Hence, "mountain" is not part of the radicals.).;5) [[deedriod](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/deedriod)] 5-5-2012(30): Heisig fails to go into detail about the top kanji, but, It's not a mountain like everyone is saying. It actually means _Thirty_ 丗 the stroke order starts with a _One_ , then draw in the three vertical lines from left to right. Then the last stroke at the bottom closing it up. Then comes the _Apron_ which makes up a **Sash**. (-Story: I made a **Sash** out of _Thirty_ cut up _Aprons_.

I can easily associate **stagnate** with _water_ but never with _sash._ And so I will now try to associate **stagnate** with something around the house that often **stagnate** s and smells awful: the kitchen _washrag_. From washrag, I will make the association with _sash_.;5) [[nesert](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nesert)] 14-10-2009(41): The _water_ became **stagnate** because the drain was clogged with a _sash_.

How about a samurai cow? He doesn't have to be a violent samurai, either. He only wears the sword because he's part of the _bushi_ **SYSTEM**. Actually, he studies ikebana, shodo, and zen. Imagine him sitting cross-legged in a Zen temple (a very _Special_ Zen temple). The master asks him if a dog has buddha nature and, shifting the swords in his belt, he calmly replies, "Moo!".;3) [[potempkin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/potempkin)] 11-9-2008(45): Gary Larson cartoon of the feudal Japanese **system** : _cows_ walking around with _belts_ , complete with katana _sabers_.

Third the raptor ruptures the cow with his _saber_ like talons.;5) [[fredde79](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fredde79)] 4-9-2007(26): I used Heisig story here but i tweaked it a little. It works better for me if i imagine the belt is around the tail of the cow, cause that it what it looks like in the kanji.

The katakana- ization of this is **ニム** バス, so the _rising cloud_ primative is just an abbreviation of that name written from top to bottom in the old Japanese style.;3) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 24-12-2008(62): Burnout!

The top line is the sky, the next 3 strokes a pair of clouds, and the final 4 dots the **rain** collected there and waiting to fall.;* As a primitive it can mean either _rain_ or _weather_ in general. Because it takes so much space, it usually has to be contracted into a crown by shortening the second and third strokes into a crown.;1) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 4-4-2007(132): From the _ceiling_ hangs a _towel_ dripping four _drops_ like **RAIN**.;2) [[shadolite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shadolite)] 19-3-2008(22): The **rain** falls from the sky, landing like teardrops on my windows.;3) [[tomusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tomusan)] 20-2-2008(18): It **rain** ed so hard that we had to put a _towel_ under the _ceiling_ to contain the _drops_ that came through.;4) [[j0k0m0](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/j0k0m0)] 1-3-2009(13): Towel hung out on a line to ….oops, it's **rain**.;5) [[ellasevia](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ellasevia)] 13-1-2010(10): A pictograph of a window with **rain** falling outside.
雲;cloud;Here is the full character for **cloud** from which the primitive for a _rising cloud_ derives. _Clouds_ begin with vapors _rising_ up in small _clouds_ from the surface of the earth, and then gathering to make **clouds** that eventually dump their _rain_ back on the earth.;;1) [[roderik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/roderik)] 22-4-2008(199): Every _rising **cloud**_ is a potential _rain_ **cloud**.

Though there is no individual word for **thunder** , there is for lightning (いなずま）, so I understand where Heisig is coming from.

Similarly, _angelic_ _women_ tend to be **attractive**.;3) [[whistler11](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/whistler11)] 3-7-2006(40): Be careful not to confuse this with _exquisite_ (women + few - frame [123]). I try to keep them distinct by remembering that all _women_ _angels_ are **attractive** , but few women are truly exquisite.;4) [[abbott](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abbott)] 24-6-2008(21): **Attractive** _women_ are usually no _angels_. On the contrary, they are usually quite bitchy.;5) [[harusame](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame)] 7-8-2009(13): Just because a _woman_ is **attractive** doesn't mean she's an _angel_.
立;stand up;This picture of a vase **standing up** has its meaning extended to represent the general posture of anything **standing up**.;* Used as a primitive, it can also mean _vase_.

The key is to remember that the bottom stroke on the _standing_ element takes those little crown "winglets" on the right and left.

She's _standing_ on her _crown_ rummaging through a high cupboard looking for her _apron._ I guess the **sovereign** 's servants have the day off.;3) [[johnzep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnzep)] 31-3-2007(34): Imaging queen Elizabeth…england's **SOVEREIGN** as she STANDS at the sink doing dishes wearing nothing but an APRON.;4) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 21-7-2009(15): The **sovereign** likes to make his female servants _stand_ around in nothing but _aprons_.

匕;spoon;This character, a pictograph of a **spoon** , is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for _seven_ , where the first stroke is written left to right (the opposite of here) and cuts noticeably across the second.;* As a primitive, this kanji can take on the additional meaning of someone _sitting on the ground_ , of which it can also be considered a pictograph.

昆;descendants;By _comparing_ apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have **descended** from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything **descended** from everything else, one way or another, means that there is  "nothing new UNDER the _sun_.

Here's my best crack at it: imagine a grandfather watching his DESCENDENTS (grandkids) playing outside under the _sun_ , silently _comparing_ them, considering which of them will grow up and make him proud.

I prefer the fancy curves of cursive. (Note: Heisig gives this character the official keyword "block letters," but based on what I've read about the meaning of the character in the Yahoo! Japan Dictionary, I prefer "print-style writing").;2) [[Magnus13](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Magnus13)] 10-7-2011(15): **Block letters** (as opposed to cursive) are rigid and lifeless like _wood_ , they're _all_ the same size so that _all_ can read them.;3) [[enoonyllaer](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/enoonyllaer)] 21-8-2010(15): _all_ the hiragana are in "block letters" on _wooden_ blocks, like children's toys.;4) [[FoxintheStars](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FoxintheStars)] 14-1-2011(4): Literally the **block letters** on children's blocks, carved into _wood_ so clearly that _all_ can read them.;5) [[Aeryon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon)] 24-1-2012(3): At the base of the tree, in white **block letters** is written the following, "In 1911, 3 men sat here and compared the whiteness of their skins.

Here a _beggar_ develops a deep **thirst** for _water_ as he crouches in his box under the hot sun.;5) [[Bullwhip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Bullwhip)] 5-6-2008(18): Have some _water_ before you take a _siesta_ , or you will wake up **thirst** y!

葛;kudzu;**Kudzu**  is a word taken over from Japanese to name the crawling vines that creep up and completely take over trees.

In the supplement pdf it does, but not here so I came up with this: **Kudzu** vines and _flowers_ grow so fast by _day_ that by night they have _bound up_ all the _animal legs_ in the forest like _fish hooks_ bind fish. It is long and convoluted, but it contains everything similar to the elements here.;5) [[amillerchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/amillerchip)] 8-1-2012(3): My Windows font is displaying the traditional form of this character, however the bottom primitive is _siesta_ as listed.

It's recoil had to be dealt with somehow, so it is placed in a tight-fitting alcove of _stone_. Hence " _stone- wrapped_ **cannon** ".;5) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 3-1-2011(16): Rather than a **cannon** , think of a catapult or trebuchet.

亀;tortoise;This is not a _turtle_ (See frame 250) but a **tortoise** , however you wish to picture the difference. Let the " _bound up_ " at the to prefer to the head, and the two _suns_ , with a long tail running through it, to the shell.;* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated to its bottom half, ⻲, and comes to mean _eel_. (If it is any help, this kanji in its full form can also be remembered through its abbreviation's primitive meaning.);1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 27-10-2007(219): It seems bizarre, but **tortoise** s are a genetic cross with the head of a fish and the tail of an eel.

竜;dragon;_Vase_ . . . _eel_.

Mushu was far from the most impressive **dragon**. He looked nothing more than a _eel_ _standing up_. Mulan was very disappointed.
滝;waterfall;_Water_ . . . _vase_ . . . _eels_.

Think about this kanji in terms of **ACCOMPLISH** or "realize" rather than a sexual encounter. Or, combine the two: the policemen thought they had **accomplished** the task of _driving out_ (see **pursue** , last frame) all the _sows_ , but they received a phone call reporting two _horny_ pigs **CONSUMMATING** on a _road_.

We end up with a _horn_ y _pursue_ r trying to **consummate** the matrimony.
家;house;This is the full character whose primitive form we learned already. To help a little, this kanji recalls the times when the "domestic" animals were, as the word itself suggests, really kept in the **house**. Hence: _house_ . . . _sow_.;;1) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 1-11-2006(245): Think of "The Three Little Pigs".

羊;sheep;This pictograph shows the animal _horns_ at the top attached to the head (3rd stroke), the front and back legs (strokes 4 and 5) and body (final stroke).;* The primitive meaning of _sheep_ can add the further connotations given in the following frame.

The shop owner said that the Norwegian Blue was **pining** for the fjords! But of course it should have been put in the _graveyard_ already. Poor buyer, he meant to give the bird away as a _valentine_ present…;4) [[szreter](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/szreter)] 15-2-2008(22): I am in the _graveyard_ **pining** for my lost _valentine_.;5) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 17-6-2008(15): Imagine an 'emo' kid **pining** away in a _graveyard_ because his _valentine_ didn't turn up… His emo make-up is running because he's crying now. (Emo kids like to hang out in graveyards 'because it's cool' or something and they were going to have a date there).

Sapling appears in numbers 634, 938, 2078, 2079, 2080, and all characters containing _angel_ 喬 (429, 430, 1221, 2104, 2120, 2369). Tip 2: The kanji 添 means "something added/attached", so think of it as a building annex.

必;invariably;First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the _heart_ , even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph "dividing" _the heart_ in half, then one has one of those **invariably** true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each _heart_ is divided into two halves.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 27-10-2007(203): You swear you'll be in love forever, but **invariably** there comes a time when your _heart_ is _divided_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 12-6-2008(97): For this kanji I **invariably** got the stroke order wrong. I nearly lost _heart_ , but decided to _stick_ (pun) to it. Then I noticed the order is 1) katakana ソ (altered slightly), 2) fishhook, 3) two drops. Now I **invariably** get it right.;3) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 21-9-2009(71): A _stake_ through the _heart_ **invariably** kills a vampire.

Is it crying because it is broken?;4) [[lee101](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lee101)] 19-8-2010(15): Heisig, your a great man. Don't let people tell you overwise.

手;hand;Any way you count them, there are either too many or too few fingers to see a good pictograph of a **hand** in this character. But that it is, and so you must.;* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single _hand_ all by itself.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 31-1-2007(99): This pictograph actually really works if you look at it as a **hand** with fingers spread and middle finger pointing down. see the very top stroke as the edge of a shirt cuff, and it will all come together.;2) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 4-8-2009(86): A **hand** is useful for 千一 (1001) things.;3) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 25-2-2007(33): Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. (the 6-fingered man).;4) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 23-11-2006(13): Heisig says it's not a very good pictograph of a human **hand** , but it _is_ a good pictograph of a cartoon **hand**. Picture Mickey Mouse's distinctive white glove with its three fingers and a thumb. The kanji that use this element can also use _Mickey Mouse_ as a primitive element in place of _hand_.;5) [[Tornadic_Indignation](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Tornadic_Indignation)] 4-5-2009(7): The slightly bent _nail_ went through _two_ of the **hand** 's fingers (this one is pretty easy to memorize).

Unfortunately, the rope **chafe** d your _hands_ and you fell .. ouch!;4) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 28-10-2005(12): Think of **chafe** in the sense of “friction” for this particular kanji. There are many garments made of _hemp_ (though maybe not gloves). Contemporary _hemp_ clothes are likely very comfortable, but for this story let's imagine rudimentary gloves which are coarse and rough like the unprocessed _hemp_ fiber, and hence, **chafe** your _hands_.;5) [[rowdyphantom](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rowdyphantom)] 3-1-2010(7): Growing _hemp_ **chafe** s your _hand_ s.
我;ego;_Hand_ . . . _fiesta_. Note how the second stroke of the _hand_ is stretched across to double up as the first stroke of the tasseled arrow we use for _fiesta_.

Graphic, perhaps … maybe even disturbing for a few of you more prudish/phobic types … but damned if it won't stick this way.;4) [[haole](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/haole)] 21-1-2010(17): That guy has such a huge **ego**.

What _righteous_ _cows_.;3) [[Danieru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Danieru)] 26-5-2008(102): There are two kanji that need to be kept separate: this one and [animal sacrifice](../v4/1559.html) (#1559 牲). Think of it this way: here there is a _cow_ and a _righteous_ person (presumably a Hindu). One must be **SACRIFICE** d, so the righteous Hindu takes the place of the holy cow.

I think it helps simplify the image, and also helps anchor the pagoda kanji in memory better as an added bonus. say this aloud once, and i think it will bring out a vivid image very quickly: "Now **board** ing the _pagoda_ ride. Please keep your _fingers_ inside at all times…".;2) [[taijuando](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando)] 20-4-2006(86): When you **board** the ship on the way out from Hawaii a beautiful crewmember takes her _fingers_ and fits a lei around you ….a lei is _flowers_ _fitted together_ with your _fingers_.;3) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 22-10-2006(39): A romantic scene.

He then concluded that genies did not **exist**. However, upon arriving home, he saw that the spout was filled with _soil_.

乃;from;This pictograph of a clenched fist is another of the "hand primitives." Take note of its rather peculiar drawing. Try to think of drawing a _fist_ (the primitive meaning)  " **from** " this character to give yourself a connotation for the otherwise abstract key word.;* The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a _fist_.;1) [[sutebun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sutebun)] 18-10-2007(218): **FROM** a pictograph of a thumbs up.

Imagine you've just arrived in Japan, but don't have a cell phone yet, so instead you're carrying around a **portable** turkey you can hold in your fist. To dial a number, just poke it with your fingers.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 5-4-2007(116): Because they have no _fingers_ , _turkeys_ must use their _fists_ when dialing on a **portable** phone.;3) [[usis35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/usis35)] 22-6-2009(36): This character is the "kei" in "keitai" (cell phone), a word you will no doubt hear often in Japan, since everyone has one.

Only take care not to confuse it with that for _beg_ (Frame 501);1) [[Killersquierl](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Killersquierl)] 22-11-2007(103): I like to think of this as a _fist_ with with brass knuckles because of the extra line.

(Then you can combine the word for hot (atsui) with the word for face (kao) and always remember how this character is read: atsukau - あつかう.).
丈;length;The **length** whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with _arms_ at full length.

Maybe this works for guys, but when you were growing up you would compare "length" with your friends trying to show how BIG you were. You wouldn't show "it" but you would spread your arms out as wide as possible to exaggerate your **length**. Maybe even so wide that you trip (I the 3rd stroke getting pushed over)! I just find it easier to relate this to the previous kanji.;4) [[fragileshards](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fragileshards)] 29-11-2007(37): This kanji demonstrates the proper technique for throwing a bowling ball the **LENGTH** of the alley.

Think about the Japanese history textbook controversy. The government **OFFICER** S choosing the textbooks are the ONE elite group determining Japan's HISTORY.

梗;spiny;This character refers originally to a deciduous, rough tree that grows on mountain plains. From this it gets the secondary sense of rugged or **spiny**. Its primitive elements: _tree_ . . . _grow late_.;;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 13-6-2007(64): I learned this one from the movie Evil Dead, but when it _grows late_ , _trees_ change shape and become **spiny** creatures!

If it GROWS LATE and you get an INFARCTION, have someone call an ambulance. In the meantime try to relax, stay under a TREE.
又;or again;Like the several abbreviations in Roman script to indicate "and" (+, &, etc.), this short two-stroke kanji is used for the similar meaning of **or again**.;* As a primitive, it will mean _crotch_ , as in the _crotch_ of the arm. Or whatever.;1) [[sindhikara](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sindhikara)] 1-8-2008(155): This keyword should really be "again" not "or again" Here is some context: think of the phrase "Jya mata" " じゃ又 " which is a farewell similar to "then again".

You can change this kanji to "again" if you change [ again FRAME 1815 ] to Re- , which is it's real meaning anyways. Also, beware of too many penis euphemisms. Associating crotch with penis is not too bad, but if you associate column, meat, gigantic, etc. with penises, you might find yourself confused as to which euphemism you meant.

Think of “flower-power” and of the “peace” in “Greenpeace” and it will make some sense hopefully. – In this kanji, we see an inauguration _speech_ being given before the Greenpeace vessel is set afloat and sent to **safeguard** our planet.;2) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 24-11-2007(128): _Words_ and _Flowers_ are exchanged between sailors and their wives before they board the _vessel_ to **safeguard** the world.;3) [[samueruht](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samueruht)] 20-1-2008(126): (With sarcasm) A Bush speech telling how all the US _vessels_ are always welcomed, covered with _flowers_ and _word_ s of gratitude for **safeguard** ing democracy from the evil doers.;4) [[astgtciv](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astgtciv)] 14-4-2007(38): The _flower vessel_ is of course the _Mayflower_ in which the pilgrims came to America in their search for turkeys.

No, because of their nonviolence pact they have decided they will fend off pirates only with their words.

It's still weird to me, but apparently reaching to your side and grabbing you neighbor's crotch is a great way to express **friend** ship.;2) [[nakome](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nakome)] 4-3-2008(111): Think of a sex **friend** (a fuck buddy if you will). The benefit of such a relationship is that there will always be a _crotch by your side_.

By the way, for those of you looking for a less anachronistic image for the _missile_ primitive as a modern rocket, try a slingshot. it's a _crotch_ (originally a tree branch) that sends missile projectiles flying into/like the _wind_.

It seems to me 溺 is the character for **drown** , and in fact it is given the keyword "drowning" later, which is just confusing to me. Story: The ship is **going down**! We were hit by a _water_ _missile_ (a torpedo).;5) [[Captain+Kanjipants](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Captain+Kanjipants)] 6-2-2010(13): When a torpedo ( _water missile_ ) hits its target, everyone **drown** s!

How to tie it to the keyword of "husk"? Easy! Afterwards, the samurai were demoted (like potato-peeling privates), and they sat around **HUSK** ING corn and cracking eggs and peanut shells (kanji refers to both 'husk' and 'shell'). A strong image to lock in the kanji: imagine samurai using their mighty swords to de- husk corn and split peanuts!

But a **BOUGH** is a main part of a tree, perhaps where the trunk splits into several large **bough** s, and so it logically utilizes the 木 radical.;3) [[tcjeff](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tcjeff)] 10-6-2008(25): I think of a **bough** as a _branch_ that's big enough to be a _tree_ itself.;4) [[MeisterLlama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama)] 29-11-2008(13): 支 (branch) is not actually used for tree branches, but rather for conceptual branches, like a store branch, or a branch of mathematics. 枝 (bough), on the other hand, is an actual _branch_ from a _tree_.;5) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-10-2005(11): As James Heisig suggests, let's take a moment to focus on the differences between a **bough** , a branch, and a twig. A twig is “a small, leafless branch of a woody plant”. A **bough** is “a large or main _branch_ of a _tree_ ” (a branch is somewhere in between the **bough** s and the twigs).
肢;limb;Part of the body . . . branch.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-10-2005(237): The **limb** s that this kanji represents are _parts of the body_ that are connected to the trunk, like the main _branches_ to a tree (“arms and legs” is the second meaning of this kanji).

茎;stalk;Flower . . . spool.;;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 18-2-2008(196): Suggestion: Replace "spool" with "toilet paper/roll". Reasons: (1) _Toilet paper/roll_ usually comes on a _spool_. (2) _Toilet paper_ is used to clean the _soil_ off your _crotch_. Story: Just get a _flower_ and carefully wrap some _toilet paper_ around its **stalk**. Spool also appears in [suspicious](../v4/716.html) (#716 怪), [lightly](../v4/717.html) (#717 軽), [diameter](../v4/882.html) (#882 径), [sutra](../v4/1360.html) (#1360 経).;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 9-8-2007(130): PRIMITIVE: _soiled crotch_ = _soiled underwear_.

His _soiled crotch_ gives him away.;3) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 18-2-2008(67): Suggestion: Replace "spool" with "toilet paper/roll".

This could be a _sandwich man_ , or a _prostitute_ (see gorgon's story). In this case, it's easily remembered as a prostitute **tempt** ing passers-by with her _mouth_. The combination will appear again in frames 1014, and 1437, and another four times in RTK Volume 3, where it is known as _streetwalker_ (which is very close).;4) [[Francois](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Francois)] 21-4-2008(20): With a hot _mouth_ , a _licence_ to screw and a _pair of legs_ , Amsterdam prostitutes are sure to **tempt** you.;5) [[dicedice](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dicedice)] 6-6-2008(16): The cop that pulled me over was such a prick, and I was sooo **tempt** ed to _mouth_ off at him!

When this primitive appears at the bottom, I will arrange my story in a way that other elements are said to be at the very top of the **mountain** (see FRAME 775 for an example).;3) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 17-2-2009(15): Chi chi chi chia.

If we do this, the kanji makes complete sense because a **mountain pass** is just _below_ the _mountain_ _top_.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 22-1-2006(76): To the north of Lorien lies the Misty Mountains, and below their towering peaks are the Mines of Moria.

Interestingly, there is also 碕 which is made of the primitives _stone_ and _strange_. The three kanjis 碕, 埼 and 崎 all have the same meanings and pronunciations.

入;enter;This character is meant to be a picture of someone walking leftwards, putting one leg forward in order to **enter** someplace. Since the  "in" side of a character is the left, it should be easy to remember the writing of this character.;* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word is expanded to include: _to go in_ , _to put in_ , _to come in_ , and the like. It generally appears atop its relative primitive, where, unlike the element for _umbrella_ , the two strokes do not touch each other, making it virtually the same as the kanji for _eight_. When it appears in any other position, however, it retains its original form.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(69): Pictograph, see book. * As a primitive, using the image of going through a door, even one that stands alone with the frame and no wall around, helps flesh out the primitive “enter”.;2) [[vgambit](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vgambit)] 26-12-2008(36): Gordon Freeman **enters** the Black Mesa corporation's headquarters on that fateful day, after starting up a game of Half-Life (this kanji looks exactly like the lambda from the logo when written).;3) [[icamonkey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/icamonkey)] 11-8-2008(11): Something only a Native American could pull off instead of saying "Come in please.".

It's important to understand that were you to _enter_ an hour with a _dagger_ and cut it into **parts** , those **parts** would be minutes.;3) [[Kurisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Kurisu)] 28-5-2008(76): Perhaps one of the most read kanji in Japanese. It means to understand, to **part** , fraction, to break up, rate, minute, etc. To understand something completly one must _enter_ a _dagger_ into it to break it up into its **part** s.

However, this is easy because a true **holy** man uses his _ear_ to listen (i.e., to God or his supplicant) before he opens his _mouth_ to speak, unlike a charlatan who just makes something up. Of course, _king_ s are often true **holy** men and prophets (e.g., King David in the bible).;3) [[lb4269](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lb4269)] 19-3-2006(57): **Holy** Hand Grenade: Monty Python: Quest for the **Holy** Grail.

One must allow the words to pierce through the _eyes_ (the window of the soul) and reach deep into the _heart_ …a symbol of thinking about and contemplating on what was said, not just the sounds of words spoken. A married man while reading his newspaper, his wife going on about something suddenly, says, "You're not **listen** ing to me, are you?" He replies, "I heard every word you said.

I guess Heisig chose this keyword for phonetic reasons and as a character it's the "man" in mandara/mandala ( 曼荼羅 ). A mandala is a graphic representation of the universe, here split in 3 planes of existance, the _sun_ representing the cosmos, the _eye_ represents the human observer, the _crotch_ represents the animal instincts.;2) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 8-11-2007(119): He' s often **ridicule** d for having his _eye_ on _crotches_ all _day_.;3) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 5-4-2007(81): Heisig really dropped the ball on this one, introducing the obscure primitive _mandala_ without a word of explanation. I choose to read it as _Nelson Mandela_ instead. Picture him under the hot _sun_ , being tormented by _cyclopes_ who constantly kick him in the _crotch_ in his South African prison. Therefore, this kanji: The _state of mind_ of _Nelson Mandela_ was to constantly **ridicule** the Apartheid system.;4) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-12-2007(68): The whole crew **ridicules** _Data_ as he's on a big hippy phase wearing _mandalas_ and such trying to explore human behavior.

One, you can say I'm sorry. Two, you can commit suicide by sabre.

I use the game- specific meaning of "penalty". Imagine a game of scrabble with a mechanical, computerized surveillance camera (the all-seeing EYE) as the game master, monitoring what the players do. If a scrabble player tries to form a WORD that is not in the robot's dictionary, that player is immediately hit with a **PENALTY** , and the robot uses his robotic arm to automatically injure the offending player with a SABER.;4) [[kaminix](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kaminix)] 10-8-2008(48): This kanji is a timeline.

濁;voiced;The key word for this kanji connotes the "muddying" effect on a soft consonant brought about by vibrating the vocal chords. For example, in English a "j" is **voiced** while a  "sh" is unvoiced. In Japanese, the し is changed to じ when it is **voiced**.

For the image of muddy, we have an _insect_ that is _bound up_ and lowered into the _water_ as bait.

臣;retainer;This kanji is actually a pictograph for an eye, distorted to make it appear that the pupil is protruding towards the right. This may not be an easy form to remember, but try this: Draw it once rather large, and notice how moving the two vertical lines on the right as far right as possible gives you the pictograph of the eye in its natural form. The "pop-eye" image belongs to an Emperor's **retainer** standing in awe before his ruler.;* As a primitive, the meaning of the key word becomes _slave_.;1) [[lifeflaw](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lifeflaw)] 17-12-2008(112): **Retainer** : _a servant, especially one who has worked for a person or familly for a long time._ Now, if you imagine looking at a **retainer** (e.g. Igor) from top, you see how he is bending his head (middle rectange) between his two shoulders as he offers something with his two hands (upper and lower lines) to his master.;2) [[yvanc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yvanc)] 12-6-2007(71): Its a pictograph of a teeth with a **retainer** in the middle.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 14-11-2007(68): **Retainer** = A slave (for the purposes of this kanji.)

Piloted as usual by everyone's favourite slave / **retainer** , R2-D2. I'll attempt to use him as a primitive in the following kanji.

Note: do not confuse with FRAME 459 “cleverness” (in which Heisig suggested the image of a fox associated with the idea of “alert, quick”). This key word here refers in fact to “wise” but Heisig probably chose **intelligent** to avoid confusion later with “wisdom” (so try to think of **intelligent** in the sense of someone wise).;4) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 2-7-2008(27): Tip: The _slave + crotch_ combination appears five times in Heisig.

行;going;By joining the top four strokes, you should get a picture of the front current of a river, the stream trailing behind. Hence the character for **going**.;* As a primitive, this character has two forms. Reduced to the left side only, it can mean a _column_ , _going_ , or a _line_ of something or other. When the middle is opened up to make room for other elements, it means a _boulevard_.;1) [[jackhuddleston](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackhuddleston)] 3-5-2008(76): To me, this looks like a bridge **going** over a body of water, being supported by columns underneath it.

So for example, you have to keep wheat enclosed so it isn't exposed to other plants.

米;rice;This kanji has a pictographic resemblance to a number of grains of **rice** lying on a plate in the shape of a star.;* As a primitive, it keeps its meaning of _rice_ , and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for _wheat_ that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of _rice_ far exceeds that of _wheat_.) It occasionally takes a different shape when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to _grains of rice_. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for _water_. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, _grains of rice_ has 5 strokes, while _water_ only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for _rice_ is an abbreviation used for the _United States_ , which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 10-10-2005(154): Stroke order: I like to think of the first two strokes as “chop sticks” with which one eats the **rice**.

箋;stationery;_Bamboo_ . . . _float_. Note that the drawing of the primitive for _float_ uses the abbreviated form that has become standard in the general-use kanji and as we met it earlier (Frames 393-95).

Here we have opted for the simpler, avant garde drawing.;;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 25-7-2007(74): Note: the spelling should be **stationery** (= paper, office supplies), not **stationary** (= not moving).

This particular ancient chinese Abacus has _eyeballs_ in place of beads, and its frame is made of _bamboo_.

It's linked to a true story: In India, the gov't implemented a **SCHEME** to make use of the abundant _bamboo belt_ in the north of the country. As compared to the hardwood _trees_ there, bamboo is highly renewable and will create rural jobs in a push for 300% increase in bamboo production. There. Bamboo, not trees.

This _acupuncturist_ who uses _bamboo_ in place of flowers to dilute _water_ into his patients (see frame 227), managed somehow to appear on the **register** of acupuncturists. Chances are, he won't stay on the **register** for long. My image is close to that of gorgon's story.;2) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 29-1-2006(106): This doctor dilutes (see 227) his patients with bamboo stalks rather than the flowers of a standard diluting acupuncturist hence he needs to be on the Bamboo Accumpunturist Diltuers (BAD) **register**. Pumping that much water into a body can be dangerous, see the huge bamboo stems with gallons of water sloshing in and out of the patient.;3) [[pmbeddall](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pmbeddall)] 20-11-2007(25): The _acupuncturist_ was not very good.

The verb (たって)こもる uses the old form of Dragon. Probably better to learn 龍 [dragon [old]](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/2981) (#2981 龍) and then get used to seeing either the old or new form of dragon in any Kanji using it as a part, rather than trying to remember one or the other.

人;person;The character for _enter_ (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for **person** , shown here, represents someone walking outwards.;* As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ). The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of _person_ so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use _person_ for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular _person_. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 27-11-2008(156): Behold Mister T (of "A-Team" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he's sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he's both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic” **person** , telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”.;2) [[ziggr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ziggr)] 1-10-2006(44): [I appreciate some people's occasional habit of using _P_ for **person** in shared stories.

化;change;Person . . . spoon.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 30-12-2005(117): Referring to a scene in the movie "The Matrix" where a girl bends a spoon with the power of her mind alone, I imagine _Mister T_ who **change** s a _spoon_ into something else (maybe the waiter forgot to bring knives or forks). Note: as a primitive, it can help to use the image of "spare **change** ", this can help you keep it distinct from other similar kanji such as "shape" or "turn into".;2) [[ezmoreldo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo)] 3-4-2008(95): I just see this one as a pictograph of a person changing position and sitting down.;3) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 17-6-2007(64): _Mr. T_ reaches into his wallet for some spare **change** but it has all **change** d into _spoons_.;4) [[Valkyrie](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Valkyrie)] 3-11-2008(32): MR.

Right, when your girlfriend is mad at you. You hope that it _changes_ everything, especially her mood. - I know, it's a bit naive… ,-).;5) [[MeisterLlama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama)] 23-1-2009(17): Man, **flower** s aren't really **flower** s unless they change. If you just have a **flower** that looks the same all the time, it's just one of those fake plastic ones. Real **flower** s change with the seasons.

Imagine getting on the **freight** train with a bunch of _spare change_. You put in some _change_ and it starts up…goes for a few minutes, then starts to slow down. You look at the slot..there's actually a slot for _spare change_ and one for regular _shells_. Your call, but it seems to prefer _spare change_ over _shells_.;3) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 17-11-2007(46): Countries like to _change_ _money_ by trading **freight**.;4) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 20-3-2009(36): This is also commonly used to mean currency, which is easier to remember given the kanji I think. When you travel abroad you change your clams into the local currency. Easy breezy.;5) [[Neobeo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Neobeo)] 13-12-2008(13): You catch the **freight** train, but suddenly realise you did not bring enough _money_. You turn out your pockets to show the inspector that you have nothing but spare _change_.
傾;lean;_Change_ . . . _head_. The key word has the sense of **leaning** on or toward someone or something.;;1) [[adhmm](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/adhmm)] 13-5-2008(206): _Mr. T_ gave a girl some _change_ to **lean** over and give him _head_.;2) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 12-5-2008(89): I didn't study for the test at all!

Poppies, huh? Please come with us, sir…".;4) [[rptb1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1)] 11-11-2005(26): A man walks through airport security with a big piece of **baggage**. The sniffer dogs go bezerk! "What's in the bag?" yell the guards. But when they open the bag they just find it's full of flowers.;5) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 31-3-2006(12): My story is similar to rptb1, only that the **baggage** is extremely heavy, and when the guards open it they see flowers and say " _What_ kind of _flowers_ is that !?" (you would never imagine flowers would make **baggage** this heavy).
俊;sagacious;Person . . . license . . . walking legs.;;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 7-9-2007(242): The entire town wants to get rid of _legal prostitutes_ , but the **sagacious** _Mr T_ realizes that they are a benefit to the economy and society. So he lets the sa-geishas stay.;2) [[PepeSeco](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/PepeSeco)] 9-10-2006(101): (re: sweetneet) Since he is not very **sagacious** , _Mr. T_ failed his driver's _license_ and now needs to resort to his _walking legs_ to get around.;3) [[sobani](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sobani)] 17-2-2009(29): This is the first time I heard of the word **sagacious** , so I looked it up at dictionary.com and found [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&q=sagacious](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?db=dictionary&q=sagacious). For the definition they give the example of "a **sagacious** lawyer". And let a lawyer be a _person_ that has a _license_ to practice law and who _walks_ frantically through the courtroom as he tries to sway the jury. To add some drama: he's defending Osama bin Laden (can be used as the _person_ element).;4) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 31-12-2009(20): People who just get their drivers _license_ think they are better than anyone else. But, in reality, the _people_ who are **sagacious** are the ones who used their _walking legs_ as much as possible (since it's better for their health).;5) [[cjon256](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256)] 1-5-2009(18): A _person_ who is has been a _streetwalker_ is probably very **sagacious** about human nature. see [tempt](../v4/766.html) (#766 唆).

(thx shimouma).;2) [[the_marshal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal)] 6-3-2006(132): Mr. T is in the street, standing up, wearing an golden crown and a compass in his hand… he's asking the **bystander** if they know how to get to buckingham palace (!).;3) [[Joyo1945](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Joyo1945)] 6-1-2009(57): _Mr. T_ is tired of being a **bystander** , he _stands up_ and takes the king's _crown_ for himself to change the _direction_ of the country.;4) [[cjon256](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256)] 1-5-2009(49): Side Note: The right side of this kanji is itself a kanji (but not a kanji given in Heisig) meaning "The right hand side of a kanji" (旁【つくり】). It can also mean "at the same time." Not sure if this is useful, but it seemed interesting…;5) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 28-5-2007(21): Many cultures have some traditional story about the _sovereign_ who disguises himself as a peasant or traveler, a **bystander** if you will, to judge the moral _compass_ of his _people_.
俺;myself;The key word refers to a very familiar way of referring to oneself, typically used by men.

He's brought down terrorist organisations, drug syndicates, but gets all worked up when catching a fish… what a guy.;3) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 9-2-2007(24): As astridtops mentions, this is "Ore". In Japanese r = l, so could write it "Ole". So picture a bullfight with _person_ as the matador and a _dachshund_ replacing the bull. The crowd keep shouting "Ole! (Ore)".;4) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 11-8-2006(15): (note: this is the kanji for 'ore'). "I, **myself** , am the _person_ who will kill the _Midgard Snake_ ", the god Thor bellows. Since he's not known for his politeness, you can see him using 'ore' to refer to himself…;5) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 25-6-2008(6): _Mr T_ is unfortunately bragging a bit here - "Myself? I have got a pretty big mini- **myself**. It's actually right around the size of a _moray eel_ , sucka." And as opposed to the Japanese, who point to their noses to refer to their own **myself** , or cultures that point to their body, when _Mr T_ wants to refer to his **myself** , he points to his _moray eel_.
久;long time;This character uses the diagonal sweep of the second stroke to double up for _bound up_ and a _person_. Think of a mummy, and the key word will not be far behind.;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 26-2-2007(225): Note: this is the ひさ in ひさしぶり . **Long time** no see _mummy_! (A bound up person).;2) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 2-3-2006(33): This is a picture of a person bowing "long time no see!".;3) [[Delina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Delina)] 13-5-2008(22): Be careful if you're using alternate primitives for this kanji! There are only three strokes, and the stroke order is similar to _bound up_ with an extra 'leg' like the last stroke of _person_. Using _recline_ and _person_ would give you four strokes. Using _drop_ and _enter_ would give the wrong stroke order and the wrong shape in handwritten kanji, even though they all look kind of the same in print. See <http://www.mahou.org/Kanji/3557/> (bottom of page) for the handwritten style.;4) [[Artemisk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Artemisk)] 19-3-2009(21): That _bound up_ _person_ is a _mummy_ , he's been that way for a **long time**.;5) [[kansaigaijin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kansaigaijin)] 28-7-2009(13): A mummy is a _person_ who has been _bound up_ for a **long time**.
畝;furrow;Think of the three kinds of **furrows** shown here in this character - a _top hat's_ rim, a _rice field's_ ridges, and the wrinkles that show you've been around a _long time_.;;1) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 19-3-2007(209): Using a TOP HAT to make **FURROW** S in the RICE FIELD takes a LONG TIME!;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 7-9-2007(107): A _mummy_ tries to **furrow** his brow but realizes that he's got no head - just a _brain_ with a _top-hat_ on it. So he **furrow** s his _brain_. [trigger: **furrow** your _brain_ ].;3) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 27-12-2007(48): A man from the city, thus wearing a _top hat_ , working in a _field_ , takes a very _long time_ to dig a simple **furrow**.;4) [[MeisterLlama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama)] 29-4-2009(20): Correct keyword: **ridge** ( 畔 - >waterside). ( 畝 is used in 畝間 , meaning **furrow** , but that's because the interval between ridges is a **furrow** ). Words: 畝 (ridge/rib), 畝織り (ridged fabric). Story: A _rice field_ is actually a secret burial ground for _mummies_. Each **ridge** is actually a sarcophagus. The _mummies_ are buried under the **ridges** , and each _mummy_ has a _top hat_ which takes up the remaining length of the **ridge** , filled with his riches.;5) [[khooks](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/khooks)] 14-6-2008(17): The farmer uses a _mummy_ to plow **furrow** s in the _field_ , but he disguises him with a _tophat_ so he doesn't scare the neighbors.

This kanji is lying.;3) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 6-2-2007(27): They've finally _pent in_ _Mr. T_. But don't worry, no one can keep T **captured** , foo!;4) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 14-10-2009(23): There is a butt **captured** within this picture. Lol!;5) [[miyadamuraman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/miyadamuraman)] 25-8-2011(15): This is a very easy kanji. A PERSON who is PENT IN is obviously **captured**. DO NOT USE MR. T! Why people are using this as a primitive element is beyond me. MR. T is the variant of person when it appears on the left side of a kanji. Do not confuse your PERSON and MR. T or you'll never know which one to use when you have a MR. T story. Keep each version of a primitive distinct in your naming. (Think of the difference between using "heart" and "valentine").
内;inside;_Person_ . . . _belt_. Note that we cannot use the primitive meaning of _hood_ here because the _person_ runs THROUGH the element, not under it.;;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 11-7-2008(135): _Mr. T_ 's new _belt_ is huge!

I guess that's kinda the point, eh?;4) [[fightswumbrellas](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fightswumbrellas)] 16-6-2009(27): A person who fell through the roof of their house, now their legs are **inside**.;5) [[taijuando](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taijuando)] 16-2-2007(12): In Washington DC someone who is an **inside** r is someone who knows everything within the _belt_ way.
丙;third class;Those no-frills flights the airlines offer to attract customers should help create an image from _ceiling_ . . . _person_ . . . _belt_. The kanji meaning " _inside_ " should not be used because of its proximity to the element for " _in_.

柄;design;Tree . . . third class.;;1) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 27-4-2008(497): Half Way!!!!;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 19-6-2006(223): This is a " _design_ " as in a "pattern", not a verb as in "to _design_ ". The **tree** grain _design_ was too expensive for the **third class** airline to use for the panelling. They just painted it.;3) [[AndamanIslander](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/AndamanIslander)] 29-4-2008(200): Makes me think of Ikea. Everything is _wooden_ and the **design** is really nice but the quality really is _third rate._.;4) [[rptb1](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rptb1)] 11-11-2005(58): The third class seats on the train are very simply **design** ed. In fact, they're not **design** ed at all. They're just wooden stumps of trees.;5) [[matt_jenkins](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins)] 12-4-2008(23): **DESIGN** makes me think of 'intelligent **design** ', the _third class_ alternative to evolution for the hard-of-thinking. You'd have to have solid _wood_ between your ears to believe it!
肉;meat;Let this doubling of one of the elements for " _inside_ " yield the sense of " _insides_ " to approach the key word, **meat**. The abbreviated form of this character gave us the primitive meaning of _flesh_ or _part of the body_ for the kanji 月.;;1) [[DrWarrior12](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrWarrior12)] 13-1-2008(176): Here we are looking at an x-ray of a cannibal whose insides are full on people-meat.;2) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 19-9-2007(61): A _person's_ _inside_ \- fleshy, raw, pink, **meat**.;3) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 24-12-2007(24): To avoid confusion with the _flesh_ primitive from [month](../v4/13.html) (#13 月), I'm nicknaming this one: _soylent green_. It's easy to remember since "Soylent green is people!".;4) [[dontpokebadgers](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dontpokebadgers)] 21-7-2010(14): Inside a person is **meat**.;5) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 28-11-2007(10): I like narafan's story that captures the primitives nicely, but I'm with Rakushun and fuaburisu - this is just a pictograph of a slab of **meat** (I picture a t-bone steak), and it gets reinforced since you constantly see it on menus.
腐;rot;Municipality . . . meat.;;1) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 19-9-2007(213): The **rotting** _meat_ _adheres_ to the _cave_ walls.;2) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 8-5-2007(65): Smaller _municipalities_ are well known for filling their budgets with _pork (meat)_. Thats why they are also well known for being **rot** ten.;3) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 7-12-2005(38): The _municipality_ workers in their _cave_ are too busy with bueraucracy and _adhering_ to rules so they cannot regulate and measure the huge delivery of _meat_ that was made days ago. So it just lies in the back of the cave to **rot** as more work piles up.;4) [[FarisB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/FarisB)] 9-6-2009(30): Resident Evil reference: The MUNICIPALITY of Raccoon City has been overrun by **ROT** TEN MEAT (zombies).;5) [[chillyrobotito](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chillyrobotito)] 8-10-2008(21): There's something **rot** ten in the municipality of Denmark.

匁;monme;This character obliges us once again to make use of a Japanese key word for want of an English equivalent. It refers to an old unit of weight, equal to about 3.75 grams.

This story should help avoid confusion with [post](../v4/824.html) (#824 職) and [employ](../v4/1083.html) (#1083 雇).

Note: also the counter for bowls (of rice) or pairs (of chopsticks), ーぜん.
年;year;In an odd fashion, the kanji for **year** joins together the element for _horse_ , on the top, and the right half of the element for _sunglasses_.

Picture it on the zodiac calendar. A horse with an eye patch.;5) [[dat5h](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dat5h)] 3-6-2009(10): NOTE: 舛 is actually a radical meaning dancing legs. Can't you see the legs twisted about a pole perhaps? I am uncertain why Heisig chose sunglasses. Consider the last _dance_ that a _horse_ performs in a **year** for some festival. What do you mean, "horses don't dance"? <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKQgTiqhPbw>.

戸;door;Ceiling . . . flag.;;1) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 10-12-2005(272): Traditional Japanese storefront **door** s have several _flags_ , known as "noren," hanging down from a curtain rod in front of them. I see this as a pseudo-pictograph, and use the horizontal line across the top to represent the curtain rod, since noren don't usually hang from the _ceiling_.;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 30-12-2006(37): A Japanese **door** has a noren, a _flag_ hanging from a _rod_.

Use your foot).;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 6-12-2007(108): The **shoulder** is _part of the body_ you use to push through the noren in a _doorway_. I was having trouble with positioning of the primitives until I tweaked shaydwyrm's story slightly. If you think of pushing through a noren, this makes sense as a pictograph. The noren hangs from above, and you push through it from below.;3) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 14-1-2006(24): A part of the body I always seem to bump against the door.;4) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 8-12-2005(15): See those pieces of _meat_ , on either sides of the _door_ frame ?

I suggest using "turn back" as keyword, which is far easier to remember compared to the abstract "re-". Do not confuse with [return](../v4/725.html) (#725 返) which has the meaning of the verb かえる - to return, to come back.

The _door_ gives up (who can resist the _taskmistress_ , hehe) and **disclose** s the information by way of a _mouth_ that appears, just like that (even in imaginary world, doors need a _mouth_ to talk).
示;show;Although the elements _two_ and _little_ are available for the using, it may be easier to remember this character as a picture of an altar. Something placed atop the altar is put on **show** for all to see.;* As a primitive, this kanji means _altar_. At the left, the abbreviated form that this element takes is made by chopping the _altar_ in half and leaving only one dot behind to represent the right side.

Basically, one gave _wealth_ to the _altar_ (i.e. priest) and received a _blessing_.

(Mnemonic: **Welfare** = _Stop_ the _altar_ ) 福祉 (ふくし): **welfare**.;5) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 29-12-2007(19): I remember this one with a political idea … don't read if you're easily offended. Ironically, many of the people on **Welfare** in the USA are the super-religious type (the sort that regularly visit their respective _altars_ ) in the American South, and tend to all have that infamous _"Footprints"_ poem (where God carries you across the beach) hanging in their living rooms. These people tend to vote conservatively (politicians that oppose federal **welfare** ), and thus … against their own best interests.
社;company;_Altar_ . . . _soil_. The **company** referred to here is that of the modern business world.;;1) [[mfistik](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mfistik)] 6-8-2007(304): When you enter a Japanese **company** it's like you join a cult… your workdesk becomes your altar and you worship the very soil the office is built on.;2) [[Delina](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Delina)] 13-6-2008(54): Some Japanese **companies** , including Toyota, have a Shinto _shrine_ on their _grounds_ to bring luck and prosperity to the **company** and its employees.;3) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 17-6-2006(39): If a **company** is built on _land_ near the _altar_ , it is believed that it will become successful.;4) [[endote](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/endote)] 30-11-2010(33): The Japanese treat their **company** like a shrine and the **company** treat them like dirt.;5) [[theasianpleaser](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/theasianpleaser)] 15-11-2008(14): An _altar_ was bulldozed and filled with _soil_ as the foundation for a new **company** building.
視;inspection;Altar . . . see.;;1) [[gorgon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gorgon)] 27-2-2006(168): The beaurocracy in Japan is such that even altars need to be **inspection** approved. A little man with glasses comes once a year to give the _altar_ a "visual once over" as he calls it (perhaps checking for unauthorised symbology?).;2) [[Ricardo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ricardo)] 2-9-2006(105): [inspection, regard as, see, look at] **Inspection** : you 示 [show](../v4/1086.html) (#1086 示) and someone else 見 [see](../v4/57.html) (#57 見).;3) [[phauna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna)] 13-2-2008(71): (Thanks to Ricardo) There's an **inspection** in the church.

The surface must be smooth as ice, not a blemish must be seen. Very well, let me see the next stone altar.
奈;Nara;We choose the city of **Nara** as the key word in this case because this kanji, frequently used in proper names, appears in **Nara** , and also because of **Nara's** famed religious monuments, which help us with the primitives: _St. Bernard dog_ . . . _altar_.;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 26-2-2007(219): It's beautiful place, but the dark side of **Nara** is that they sacrifice _St. Bernards_ on _evil altars_ every night after the tourists leave!;2) [[ezmoreldo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ezmoreldo)] 3-4-2008(129): **Nara** is just a _big_ _show_ for tourists.;3) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 17-5-2006(65): There is a BIG ALTAR in **NARA**. (really! :-) ).;4) [[nolusu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nolusu)] 8-8-2007(25): **Nara** is famous for its deers running freely everywhere. To avoid any accidents, Shepperd dogs are put on to the temple's altars to stop the deer from entering the temples.;5) [[ashman63](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ashman63)] 13-5-2008(15): Toudaiji Temple in **Nara** is one heck of a _big altar_.
尉;military officer;Flag . . . altar . . . glue.;;1) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 11-9-2007(189): Of course it had to be the **military officer** 's idea to _glue_ a _national flag_ to the _altar_ he's stationed at.;2) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 21-2-2006(81): Perhaps you have heard about Koizumis controversial visits at the Yasukuni war memorial shrine. It is the japanese flag waving above a small stone altar. A **military officer** keeps watch here night and day, to honor the dead war heroes, as if he is glued to the ground.;3) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 7-10-2007(27): Only way I remember this is think of a **MILITARY OFFICER** standing next to a FLAG draped ALTAR (well, the coffin is by the altar) as if GLUED to it. Might hurt if you think that GLUED primitive looks like the **MILITARY OFFICER** is saluting the FLAG draped ALTAR, with a slight tear coming from the eye.;4) [[bihzad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bihzad)] 6-3-2008(22): **Military officer** s glue their flags to the altars of the countries they've conquered.;5) [[KristinHolly](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/KristinHolly)] 5-9-2008(17): The **military officer** is even patriotic when he watches tv.

The story goes something like this: As a way of providing **consolation** to battle-weary, _heartsick military officers and soldiers_ , the Japanese set up comfort stations (brothels) for their servicemen. (Just to be clear: this is not an endorsement of the practice, just a way to remember the Kanji.).;3) [[shakkun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/shakkun)] 14-6-2008(39): The MILITARY OFFICER is given a Purple HEART by the army as **consolation** for the wounds he received in the line of duty.;4) [[hunchbag](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/hunchbag)] 19-11-2009(33): The _military officer_ consoles the parents: "Well, your son did not win the war. He died. But, as a **consolation** prize, you get his _heart_!" TA-DAAA!! "Thanks for playing, folks!"

He is a kind man and for the day his _goodwill_ benefits everyone. No beheadings.;4) [[subhuman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/subhuman)] 11-1-2008(24): **Goodwill** is something that _samurais_ _show_ and other warriors just _lack_.;5) [[Deborah](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Deborah)] 14-1-2008(21): **Goodwill** Hunting, the Japanese version. Will is played by Toshio Mifune, a former _SAMURAI_ who dreams of attending MIT. However he _LACKS_ confidence and instead works polishing _ALTARS_ at a nearby temple.
禁;prohibition;Grove . . . altar.;;1) [[snallygaster](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster)] 26-9-2007(224): Similar to radical tyro's story. If you live in Japan, your main exposure to this kanji is probably "no smoking" signs. So I imagine the government enacting a **prohibition** of tobacco, and burning whole groves of tobacco plants on an altar (the altar of public health, or self-righteousness, if you will).;2) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 7-8-2007(37): Hidden in a _grove_ was a church with a secret _altar_ that was stocked full of **prohibited** alcohol during the American **prohibition** period of 1920-1933. A local registered himself as a mininster of this _altar_ so he could stock **prohibited** alcohol "for sacremental purposes" and share it with his _kin_ (きん).;3) [[genbaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku)] 13-1-2008(25): Placing trees on this alter is prohibited.;4) [[Antunes](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Antunes)] 21-12-2006(21): When Chirstianity was prohibited and the christians were being chased in Japan they had to hide their altars under the groves.;5) [[harusame](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame)] 29-5-2009(12): During **prohibition** , people drank hidden in _groves_ so that they wouldn't be _shown_ drinking in public.

Now they're nothing but festivals, but back in the day they were **ritual** s.

Unfortunately, perhaps forever.;4) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 18-1-2008(12): This kanji is used for **festivals**.

察;guess;" **Guess** " here has the sense of a measured conjecture.

由;wherefore;The " **wherefore** " of this kanji explains the reason or origin of a thing. It does this graphically by depicting a seed in a _rice field_ sending up a single sprout, which is the whole why and **wherefore** of the seed's falling in the earth and dying. (When the _flower_ appears, you will recall from frame 249, we have a full _seedling_.);* As a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean _shoot_ or _sprout_.;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 13-11-2007(155): " **Wherefore** art thou, _Sprouteo_?"

For one, it's often mistranslated as "where" when in fact it's an urge to know a cause or reason, and two, because this kanji represents the reason, not the urge. [A thought _sprouts_ from my _brain_. I think, **therefore** I am.].;3) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 4-7-2007(37): Errata: Stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. The vertical stroke is #3.

笛;flute;Bamboo . . . sprout.;;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 7-4-2007(186): **Flute** is made of _bamboo_ _sprout_.;2) [[Django](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django)] 25-12-2008(126): You pick up your _bamboo_ **flute** , and recoil in shock as out comes not the dulcet melody you had hoped to play, but rather a _Brussels sprout_! You play again, and again a Brussels sprout. A _bamboo_ **flute** that plays _sprouts_! Fabulous! Puts that golden egg laying goose in its place.;3) [[tummai](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/tummai)] 21-5-2008(77): Bamboo shoots… make good **flute** s.;4) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 19-2-2006(18): Our japanese Pied Piper plays his magic **flute** to make the _bamboo sprouts_ grow quicker up, so that he can cut them and craft himself a proper shakuhachi **flute**.;5) [[desmidus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/desmidus)] 27-2-2008(14): The troublesome boy used his bamboo **flute** in music class as a projectile weapon, firing brussel sprouts at various unsuspecting girls as well as the teacher.
軸;axis;Car . . . shoot.;;1) [[kyldyyr](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kyldyyr)] 25-11-2005(176): An absurd image, but what the heck - worked for me. Imagine a _car_ going across a plain at a fast speed. Suddenly a single _sprout_ (the only one to be seen) gets stuck to the car's wheels, causing the car to fly around its **axis**.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 4-3-2007(130): The Germans manufactured so many _cars_ during World War II that it was almost as if they were _sprouting_ from the factories of the **Axis**.;3) [[samuize](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/samuize)] 13-12-2007(51): Left side is the car, right side is a zoomed in picture of the car showing the detail of the axle/axis.;4) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 30-12-2007(27): George W. Bush placed a great deal of Middle Eastern countries in his " **Axis** of Evil" … perhaps because that region is the _sprouting origin_ of what we have to put into our _cars_ (let's bring back the electric car, eh?).;5) [[etpan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/etpan)] 23-11-2008(25): James Bond has guns that _sprout_ from the wheel **axes** of his _car_.
甲;armor;This kanji reverses the element for _sprout_ , giving the image of roots being sent down into the earth by a seed planted in the _rice field_. From there you must invent a connection to the keyword, **armor**.;* The primitive meaning is _roots_. Important to that word is the image of  "pushing downwards," as _roots_ do.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 20-1-2006(200): Funny.. this appeared to me as a pictograph of a samurai's **armor**. Then I looked up images of the samurai **armor** and it is not even remotely similar. Then I realised it looks in fact like the belly of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which I somehow associated with the samurai **armor** because of the "turtle samurai" that appeared earlier. Fits me. The bit that pokes down is to protect the genitals, I guess.;2) [[ruisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruisu)] 21-11-2007(156): It looks like a bird's eye view of a tank (modern **armor** ).;3) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 22-8-2006(60): Pictograph. Kendo visor with chin guard.;4) [[Wile_e42](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Wile_e42)] 17-4-2008(36): Armour weighs you down like you’re rooted to the ground.;5) [[Viking101](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101)] 4-1-2010(14): Looks like an **armor** ed helmet. You have the part that protects the _brain_ and a little line beneath that acts as a nose guard.
押;push;_Fingers_ . . . _roots_. Compare and contrast with _pluck_ (Frame 1187).;;1) [[narafan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/narafan)] 2-10-2007(154): **Push** the _roots_ down, instead of plucking the seedling.;2) [[smithsonian](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smithsonian)] 4-3-2007(100): Use your _fingers_ to make sure the _roots_ of your plant are deep underground by **pushing** them down, down, down.;3) [[Codexus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Codexus)] 26-12-2007(67): **Push** the button with your _finger_ and get _root_ beer!;4) [[claxton](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/claxton)] 25-7-2008(17): For those who liked the "bird's eye view of the tank" imagine a tank that has its tracks stuck in the sand. The big green machine is extremely hot from the desert sun as well as the heat its engine has created. With that picture in mind, this Kanji depicts what happens next when the soldiers get around the back of the tank and have to **push** it with their fingers because the surface is too hot for them to put their hands on.;5) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 10-5-2008(16): You are wearing your cool new _Ninja Turtles Shell Armour_ and you realize that there's a little button with a _finger_ symbol on it, inviting you to **push** it. You **push** it, and the front wall of the shell **push** es out violently. You've learned a new attack - this isn't just a defense tool anymore, you can now run around and **push** people around for no reason! Cool!
岬;headland;Like the _cape_ (Frame 164) and the _promontory_ (Frame 840), the **headland** refers to a jut of land. Its elements: _mountain_ . . . _roots_.;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 10-3-2007(206): A **headland** is a _mountain_ that is firmly _rooted_ despite being surrounded on 3 sides by water. (Just like your head is a mountain surrounded by air on 3 sides, a **headland**!).;2) [[matt_jenkins](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matt_jenkins)] 21-4-2008(125): **Headland** s are natural forts, in fact, once men build castles on them, they become _armoured mountains_. (Gibralter, for example, is basically an _armoured mountain_ ).;3) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 10-11-2008(26): A _mountain_ that has been _pushed_ into the sea.;4) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 7-1-2011(22): The **headland** is _mountain_ ous terrain that provides a natural fortification (or _armour_ ) against sea-borne invasion. 岬 (みさき) : cape (on coast).;5) [[dilandau23](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau23)] 9-1-2007(19): Forget confusing the meanings ( **headland** , [promontory](../v4/778.html) (#778 崎), [cape](../v4/153.html) (#153 埼)) they are synonyms, no way around that. Luckily, all three seem to be used in names most. I used: The **headland** or **head** of the **land** is obviously the part of the land that is placed highest, in the same way our head is highest on the body. _Mountains_ are the **head** s of the **land** s they have planted their _roots_ into.
挿;insert;_Fingers_ . . . _thousand_ . . . _roots_. Observe how the writing order does not follow the elements in order, because the final stroke is used for two different elements.;;1) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 25-9-2006(245): A rice farmer's delicate _fingers_ have **insert** ed _1,000 rooted_ seedlings into his field.;2) [[Ramchip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Ramchip)] 28-5-2008(156): Imagine a crazy japanese hentai: multiple fingers and _thousand_ of _root_ -like tentacles are **insert** ing themselves in… well, I think you can fill the rest.;3) [[wasurenaide](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/wasurenaide)] 24-11-2007(47): Before you _push_ the button for the _ginseng root_ tea, you must **insert** _1000_ yen.;4) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 19-7-2007(20): _Fingers_ , the thief, is trying to get money using my ATM card. After **insert** ing it in the ATM, he tried _1000 times_ to _push_ the right buttons. And got my pin right number on the last try! Notice the long vertical stroke done last!;5) [[pazustep](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pazustep)] 2-8-2008(13): Weird arcade machine this one. Instead of reading "insert coin", it reads " **insert** _1,000 roots_ ". I hope you can play until your _fingers_ get sore, for that price!
申;speaketh;The olde English is used here to indicate a humble form of the third person singular of the verb "to speak." It is written by a _tongue wagging in the mouth_ with a _walking stick_ rammed through it and coming out at both ends.;* While this kanji has obvious affinities to the "seed" group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the _monkey_ (the one who _speaketh_ no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take _monkey_ as its primitive meaning.;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 15-8-2006(181): I imagine thomeone who can not pronounth the "s" and **speaketh** like thith becauth they have a _cane_ in their _mouth_.;2) [[mcfate](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcfate)] 14-2-2008(90): I had persistent trouble confusing this one with 曰 [sayeth](../v4/578.html) (#578 曰). The way I keep it sorted out is that this one is used in "moshi moshi" when answering the phone, similar to the way an American would say "hello, this is X **speaking**.".;3) [[mistamark](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mistamark)] 26-10-2008(61): The _cross_ in the _mouth_ of the _Monkey_ ensured it **speaketh** no evil.;4) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 26-5-2007(21): A MONKEY can't **SPEAKETH** of anything if he has a WALKING STICK driven through his TOUNGE WAGGING IN HIS MOUTH.;5) [[furrykef](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef)] 2-7-2008(14): Distinguished from [sayeth](../v4/578.html) (#578 曰) in that we're surprised that the _monkey_ can speak at all: "The monkey **speaketh**!".
伸;expand;Person . . . monkey.;;1) [[Akuji](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Akuji)] 18-2-2006(146): Here we see Mr. T. **expand** ing his gang with some trained fighter monkeys.;2) [[notgoing2argue](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/notgoing2argue)] 17-7-2007(95): Mr. T wants to show you the incredible **expand** ing monkey trick. He grabs a monkey by the tail and neck, stretches him out a few times, then blows him up like a balloon. The monkey **EXPAND** s until it pops. Haha, sucka monkey, I pity you foo.;3) [[uberstuber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberstuber)] 26-5-2007(53): A _person_ _speaketh_ and **expand** s my knowledge.;4) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 3-5-2007(38): A _person_ is really just a _monkey_ that has been **expand** ed and stretched out a bit to stand up straight and use speech.;5) [[BigAmish](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/BigAmish)] 15-8-2008(20): _Mr. T_ 's waistline is **EXPAND** ing because he has been eating too much "Chunky _MONKEY_ " ice cream!. "I pity the foo that doesn't like Ben & Jerry's ice cream!".
神;gods;Altar . . . monkey.;;1) [[Floatingweed5](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Floatingweed5)] 10-9-2007(108): The **Gods** are gathered around debating Zeus' latest purchase for Mount Olympus. A huge and extremely kitsch gilded altar in the shape of giant "speak no evil" monkey. Hera decides she will never let him go shopping alone again .;2) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 30-12-2006(107): Hinduism has many **gods** , not just one God. One of the most famous of these **gods** is Hanuman the _monkey_.

(Update: new link <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYXFppaKLL4>).;4) [[ambassadog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ambassadog)] 26-10-2009(23): Heard about the fourth wise _monkey_? Often overlooked after Hear, See and Speak no Evil, he's **Seek** no Evil. Picture the four famous monkeys at Nikko, the fourth covering his _crotch_ with his _fingers_ , showing he won't be **searching** for any evil deeds in that evil place.;5) [[Peppi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi)] 28-3-2009(18): Watch this VIDEO and you will definitely never forget this kanji. Just ask yourself what the monkey was **search** ing for: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICaFDq8_Ik&feature=related](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ICaFDq8_Ik&feature=related) (or youtube **search** : "monkey ass").
果;fruit;The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the _tree_ ) and comes to fruition, producing **fruit** full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for _brains_ at the top, which might prove more helpful than _rice field_ for creating an image. The writing, however, follows the order of a _sun_ with a _tree_ whose trunk runs through the _sun_.;;1) [[vionnacrowe](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/vionnacrowe)] 11-3-2007(259): If only Eve had used her brains and not taken the forbidden **fruit** from the tree.;2) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 24-7-2006(55): There really are _brain_ **fruit** _trees_. See <http://www.dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=108312>. Enough said.;3) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 14-1-2006(36): Just a pictogram of a cluster of **fruit** on a tree.;4) [[taikura](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/taikura)] 17-1-2009(9): **Fruit** is like a productive _rice field_ that grows on top of a _tree_. 悪因悪果 (sewing  & reaping evil). 悪果 (bad results). 無花果果 (fig). 因果 (cause & effect). 規模効果 (economies of scale).;5) [[Johnnyltn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Johnnyltn)] 20-8-2006(9): Instead of _brains_ use _rice field_ and we see a bunch of _fruit_ trees growing about the perimeter of a _rice field_.
菓;confectionary;Flowers . . . fruits.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 13-8-2007(218): This candy is made in the shape of a _flower_ , each petal with the taste of a different _fruit_.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 14-1-2006(107): Candy is coloured like flowers and flavoured like fruit.;3) [[pageturner1988](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/pageturner1988)] 5-2-2008(39): I think of Willy Wonka's factory where the flowers all bear **candy** fruits.;4) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 18-12-2010(25): Willy Wonka, the **confectionary** wizard, is probably the only man with the _brains_ to develop a _tree_ whose _flowers_ are all **candy**. 菓子 かし pastry, 菓子 みずがし fruit.;5) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 3-9-2008(16): In Japan, **candy** can be flavored like _fruit_ or _flowers_ (e.g. rose-flavored gum).

(Thanks Misha!).;2) [[misha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/misha)] 26-9-2007(135): _Words_ signify the written words in a book. The _fruit_ represents something whole, complete. A **chapter** in a book often offers a complete idea, setting, or account. It's good to disambiguate the keyword from [paragraph](../v4/82.html) (#82 項). To reinforce the kanji, imagine eating a fruit at the end of each **chapter** of Tolstoy's "War and Peace" to reward yourself. (If you ate a fruit at the end of each paragraph, you'd very quickly run out of fruit).;3) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 12-9-2007(49): The _words_ of each **chapter** bear a different _fruit_.;4) [[TheSlakey](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/TheSlakey)] 12-12-2008(38): The first **chapter** of the Bible are _words_ telling the story of _Adam and Eve_ and how they ate the forbidden _fruit_.;5) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 5-10-2007(17): Here we think of the **CHAPTER** of the bible, namely **CHAPTER** three where you hear the lord SAY "Who has eaten of the forbidden FRUIT?"

I've got some nice _melons_ and a fresh _peach_ waiting for you. Don't you want to taste my forbidden _fruits_ …?;3) [[jmadsen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmadsen)] 13-2-2006(29): Eve was **naked** until she ate of the _fruit_ and put a _cloak_ on.;4) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 14-1-2006(20): A cloak hides the fruit-bearing parts of one's **naked** body.;5) [[kanjihito](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kanjihito)] 26-10-2012(18): The _cloak_ slipped to her side to reveal her **naked** _fruit_ (don't confuse with [undress](../v4/498.html) (#498 脱)).

Blood everywhere! (thanks scottamus!). [Shibo] Errata: stroke order in 4th edition is wrong. Top stroke is first. [radical_tyro] Warning: unlike the nail primitive, notice that the **axe** does not have a hook on the last stroke. [Ramchip] I just wanted to combine these as they were all very helpful.

(Don't forget to imagine the _ax_ ).;4) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 7-12-2006(26): This more accurately means "take apart" or "analyse", so I guess, once you **chop** down the tree with an axe, you can analyse its structure.;5) [[johngwk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johngwk)] 17-7-2011(6): To **chop** the TREE– use an AXE.

So, I see grover on the _road_ somewhere and I shout to him and ask him if he can show me " **near** ".

So here they are at the factory with a huge _garbage pail-sized measuring cup_ , putting the appropriate amount of _wheat_ into each box.
図;map;_Pent in_ . . . _Big Dipper_. Hint: among the songs dating from the days of slavery that have become part of American folklore is one called  "Follow the Drinking Gourd." It referred to the nighttime travel of runaway slaves (those _pent in_ ) who had no **maps** other than the stars to guide them, among them the bright and predominant _Big Dipper_ , the "Drinking Gourd.";;1) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 16-4-2007(217): Can't see direct relation to [Big Dipper](../v4/1177.html) (#1177 斗) since its writing order is completely different. As raulir noted, it's written as overlapping at the last stroke of ツ and the first of メ. I take it as a pictograph or treasure **map**. Two dots represent big trees and the cross (marking the treasure) is placed relative to them.;2) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 27-3-2011(56): A pictograph of a treasure **map**. Two steps east then X marks the spot. 図る はかる attempt, deceive, 地図 ちず **map** , 意図する いとする make a goal, intend to do, 図々しい ずうずうしい impudent, shameless, 図書館 としょかん library.;3) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 20-6-2006(23): When I arrived in Hollywood, I bought what they call a "star **map**." Much to my dismay, it didn't even show the location of the _big dipper_!;4) [[ruuku35](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ruuku35)] 2-5-2007(14): A PENT IN BIG DIPPER is an astronomy **MAP**.;5) [[cingold](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cingold)] 12-10-2009(11): Ahem, it looks like a Trea- _tsu me_ p, er a treasure **map** …
用;utilize;_Meat_ . . . _walking stick_. Be sure to keep this key word distinct from that for _use_ (Frame 1065). The stroke order is exactly as you would expect it from the order of the primitive elements as given.;* As a primitive element, we shall substitute the image of a _screwdriver_ , perhaps the most _utilized_ of all tools around the house.;1) [[decamer0n](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/decamer0n)] 7-5-2007(141): To tenderize _meat_ in an emergency wilderness situation, just **utilize** your _walking stick_!;2) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 20-12-2007(115): I'll confuse this with [use](../v4/990.html) (#990 使), so build a distinction right from the start. For me, "utilize" has an artificial, business-speak connotation, you only **utilize** "utilize" when you're trying to puff up what you're saying and sound important. So: "BioTools Inc introduces the FG2000 screwdriver, **utilizing** the our latest _Flesh_ Grip(tm) technology!" I'm seeing this as a picture of a stubby screwdriver with a handle made of _flesh_ , a short _shaft_ , and prongs to hold a screw in place until you drive it.;3) [[nmkohi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nmkohi)] 4-4-2006(74): When your flesh is weak you must **utilize** a walking stick.;4) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 18-5-2008(35): We have to **utilize** different tools for different jobs. If some object in your kitchen needs to be be screwed, you would **utilize** a **screwdriver**. If your woman needs to be screwed, you would **utilize** your _meat stick_.;5) [[ihatobu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ihatobu)] 10-10-2008(27): NASA **utilize** s a giant laser to cut the moon in half. Very shortly, the Earth will have two _companion_ moons.
庸;comfortable;Cave . . . rake . . . screwdriver.;;1) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 15-1-2008(246): To live a **comfortable** life, single men need only a cave for living, a rake for cleaning and a screwdriver for fixing.;2) [[Stormchild](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild)] 3-8-2006(68): When I first moved in to my new _cave_ , all I had was a bed (see [bed](../v4/592.html) (#592 床)). But now I've settled in, got myself a few handy things like a _rake_ and a _screwdriver_ , and made myself more **comfortable**.;3) [[jameserb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb)] 27-4-2008(49): To make your cave more **comfortable** , you'll need to do some work with a rake and screwdriver. Clean it up. Fix a few things.;4) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 24-11-2008(21): Commonplace seems like a better keyword for this, though it's easier to confuse with others like "usual" and "mediocre". In this case, commonplace refers to something ordinary and non-exceptional. I picture a commonplace caveman's cave, with very ordinary, non-fancy, cave drawings he did with a screwdriver because he couldn't afford a writing brush. You have to visualize him etching the drawings with the screwdriver.;5) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 8-2-2008(18): (Thanks rtkrtk) To live a **comfortable** life, the Flintstones need only a cave for living, a rake for cleaning and a screwdriver for fixing.
備;equip;_Person_ . . . _flowers_ . . . _cliff_ . . . _screwdriver_. In cases like this you can jumble up the primitive into any order that seems best for the composition of a story, provided you feel confident about the relative position that those primitives take to one another in the completed character.;;1) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 14-2-2006(282): Mr. T wants to climb up and pick the flowers at the top of the cliff. He **equip** s himself with screwdrivers to use as climbing spikes to reach the top of the cliff. Imagine a large AMMO belt full of philips screwdrivers instead of bullets.;2) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 12-9-2007(45): An RPG where you're using _Mr T_ as a character. Before you enter a battle, you **equip** the _flower cliff screwdriver_. This is a small _screwdriver_ obtained at the bottom of a _cliff_ that, when used in battle, shoots out pink _flowers_. When they touch the ground in front of the enemy, they create a massive cliff, and the ground under the enemy falls away into the sea. Picture being at the item select menu and **EQUIP** ping this item just before facing a tough boss.;3) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 20-6-2006(29): A _person_ **equip** ping themselves with _flowers_ they will _utilize_ to beautify the barren _cliff_.;4) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 20-12-2006(20): _Mr. T_ falls from the edge of a _cliff_ but grabs hold of a _flower_ to save his life. He then shoves a _screwdriver_ into the dirt and lifts himself up to safety. "I pity the fool who doesn't come **equip** ed," he quips.;5) [[uberclimber](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/uberclimber)] 26-11-2010(12): _Jedi_ Anakin wanted to present Padme with some rare _flowers_ which only grow at the top of a high _cliff_ on Naboo. To **equip** himself for the climb, he only carried a sonic _screwdriver_ , since he was able to _utilise_ his Jedi powers. 準備 じゅんび preparation, 備える (そなえる) : to furnish, to provide for, to **equip** , to install, to have ready, to prepare for, to possess, to have, to be endowed with, to be armed with, 守備 (しゅび) : defense.
昔;once upon a time;_Salad_ . . . _days_. This is the character with which Japanese fairytales commonly begin.;;1) [[the_marshal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/the_marshal)] 30-4-2006(209): **Once upon a time** , the children were forced to eat their salad every day.;2) [[andye](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/andye)] 11-1-2007(147): For those who don't know the expression, "salad days" means the time of one's youth. (originally from Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra - see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_days>). I suspect Heisig chose "salad" as the name for the radical just for this phrase…;3) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 20-10-2007(107): **Once upon a time** there was a McDonald's _salad_ and it was left out in the sun for a whole _day_. But … nothing happened because it was a McDonald's salad, chock full of preservatives and other garbage. The salad lived happily ever after (and so did the person who didn't eat it). The end. [I didn't write this… the original author deleted it… but it's my favourite story on the whole site.].;4) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 31-1-2010(19): This is the kanji for "mukashi". Often used for "once upon a time" or "long time ago". I will take this kanji to mean "really fucking long time ago"……A really fucking long time ago, I use to eat _salad_ every _day_ and was very slim…..those days are long gone and I'm now fat as a pig…;5) [[Hujis](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis)] 2-3-2009(8): **Once upon a time** there was a ruler called _ceaser_ (shiza sarada). He ruled everything under the _sun_ , even the _sun_ worshiping egyptians, until one _day_ he was killed and then his _sun_ Augustous took over. I think Ceaser will be an easier primitive than **once upon a time**. N.B. It's worked really well for me over the next couple of kanji.
錯;confused;Metal . . . once upon a time.;;1) [[javiergakusei](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/javiergakusei)] 14-9-2007(181): A long time ago, people of the world got **confused** because there were so many kinds of Metal coins. today we only have the euro.;2) [[Stormchild](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Stormchild)] 3-8-2006(157): _Once upon a time_ , it was thought that the ancient "art" of alchemy could transform anything into _gold_.

These days you go to a bank.
惜;pity;_State of mind_ . . . _once upon a time_. The sense of the key word is that of a lost opportunity or bad turn of affairs, as in the phrase  "What a **pity**! ";;1) [[jmadsen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmadsen)] 13-2-2006(189): What a **pity**!

(Raichu,11-7-2006) The way I remember it's 昔 [once upon a time](../v4/1184.html) (#1184 昔) rather than 旧 [olden times](../v4/35.html) (#35 旧) is that they began to use cutlery to eat _salad_. (I also think about how when you visit the Medieval Times theme park, which is set in _Once upon a time_ , their gimmick is that you eat with your fingers.).;2) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 8-2-2008(119): " _Once upon a time_ …" Oh hell, you're just too old for this. You close your fairy tale book and set it aside, pushing it away with your _fingers_.;3) [[billyclyde](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde)] 13-8-2007(53): To **set aside** in the sense of giving it up.

So when he was enjoying his _salad_ and found a bit of _flesh_ **scatter** ed in it, he flipped out and **scatter** ed it all over the floor.

Just some lettuce, the taskmaster answers, oh, and some human flesh. Everybody **scatter** s from the dinner table.
廿;twenty;The two _tens_ joined at the bottom by a short line is actually the old character for **twenty** , which we might as well learn since we need its primitive form.

This primitive meaning works well for all kanji it occurs in, I've posted stories for all of them. STORY: Wealthy people have a _sauna_ in their house, but **commoner** s have to use their _oven fire_ to warm themselves.;4) [[Immacolata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Immacolata)] 7-2-2006(25): I draw upon The Two Towers again. Imagine the scene where the people of rohan seeks refuge in the cavernous fortress of Helms Cleft.

The idea of a "road-block **intercept** ing" people can't be used twice, so here's an alternative: The children from the local village (merely _commoners_ ) walked up to the overpass of the nearby _highway_ and **intercepted** the communications of passing truckers using their little CB radio.;5) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 16-4-2010(8): In Lord of the Rings, the COMMONERS are **INTERCEPT** ED on the ROAD to Helms Deep.

STORY: You don't directly sit on the wooden **seat** in the _sauna_ – rather, you put a _towel_ underneath.;3) [[mikedough2](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mikedough2)] 3-1-2008(49): You're tired from walking the tour at this _cavern_ and there's no benches to sit down on, so you take a _towel_ and sling it up into a hammock-like **seat** using the stalagmites.

度;degrees;This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: _caverns_ . . . _crotch_.;;1) [[jimsublimeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimsublimeman)] 4-12-2007(225): The _cavern refugees_ are so poor that they can't afford thermometers. So, the menfolk expose their _crotches_ inside the cavern, and approximate the temperature in **degrees** from how shrivelled everything looks downstairs…;2) [[jameserb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jameserb)] 3-5-2008(64): The cave is twenty **degrees** cooler than the outdoors. Twenty male crotches experience shrinkage.;3) [[epsilondelta](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/epsilondelta)] 14-12-2009(62): PRIMITIVE: _Cave_ \+ _twenty_ = **Finnish sauna** (instead of Heisig's "caverns", which I'd confuse with "cave"). STORY: When it gets 95 **degrees** Celsius (or 200 **degrees** Fahrenheit) in the _sauna_ , you start feeling the heat in your _crotch_.;4) [[matticus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matticus)] 20-12-2005(32): You might want to pick a seat in the _cavern_ a little closer to the cooking fire, though. Otherwise, the second you sit down on the cold rocks, the temperature of your _crotch_ will drop about fifty **degrees**!;5) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 8-2-2008(15): (Continuing story from previous kanji - thanks matticus) One of the commoners has no towel.

Naturally it can only cross the _water_ if it's not frozen, so the temperature must be above 0 _degrees_.;2) [[Istvan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Istvan)] 15-7-2007(29): The **transit** system in Tokyo is one of the best in the wrold, but why is it that when it is 35 degrees outside, it is about 2 degrees on the train? Or when it is 2 degrees outside, it is 35 degrees inside the train. This degree of difference means I am always sweating then getting the chills! I think I caught a fever!;3) [[Perry](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Perry)] 16-3-2009(25): Hint: This is most commonly used in わたる, meaning to cross (a river etc) - most of the other readings are fairly obscure. I guess Heisig didn't use that because of the earlier 'crossing' kanji, but there we go.

The invention of the **printing block** ensured all copies would be identical to the original, thus it is **anti-one-sided**.

It's the very part of the very familiar kanji for **photograph** : 写真 （しゃーしん）, which is what I will let this kanji represent.;5) [[Nukemarine](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nukemarine)] 13-10-2007(20): I think of the **COPY** of the CROWN that was BESTOWED upon David after he slew Goliath with ONE SLING.
身;somebody;The key word **somebody** was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the _nose_ (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for _oneself_ ). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of **somebody** with a prominent paunch.;;1) [[mspertus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mspertus)] 8-12-2006(230): **Somebody** was just looking for you. He had a long _nose_ that reaches down below his mouth, and a long jaw that sticks out past his nose, and a scar across his face.

I think they were from the Brazilian rainforest.;5) [[kapalama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama)] 16-6-2010(10): 身体 [somebody](../v4/1248.html) (#1248 身) シン, み … Note: horrible keyword. Synonym for 体 … Parts: 自 , 丿 … Story:Though 体 has mostly the same meanings this one has more to do with the human body rather than the general idea of body. 車体 is a car body for instance. So **Some one's Body** might be a better keyword, so : 自分ノ body. … 熟語 : 独身 , 身長 , 身に着ける , 全身 , 変身 … cf: 発射 ,.
射;shoot;"I **shot** an arrow into the air, And it landed I know not where " goes the poem. (The poor poet obviously loses a lot of arrows.) This kanji, however, tells us where it did land.

老;old man;First, do not confuse this character with _venerable old man_ (Frame 849), which is far more rarely used. The character for an **old man** begins with an abbreviation of the character for _somebody_ , the _nose_ having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines. But there is another, simpler way to remember it all: the _soil_ drawn first indicates that one has come close to the age when  "dust to dust" begins to take on a personal meaning, the diagonal _walking stick_ for getting around, and the _spoon_ for being spoon- fed.;* As a primitive, the meaning is the same, but the final two strokes are omitted so that they can be replaced with other elements.;1) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 18-12-2006(200): An **old man** , wondering what it's like in a grave, _sits_ in a freshly dug plot. When a gravekeeper mistakes him for dead and begins burying him with _soil_ , the **old man** saves himself by flailing his _walking stick_ in the air.;2) [[aphasiac](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac)] 14-8-2009(71): The _dirty_ **old man** had a _stroke_ so now he must be _spoon_ fed.;3) [[libsrone](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/libsrone)] 30-5-2008(37): **Old man** sits in the dirt, having a stroke.;4) [[myglagata](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/myglagata)] 18-3-2009(18): An **OLD MAN** in a Japanese nursing home must follow the rules: _no_ _spoon_ ing the nurses or _soil_ ing pants.

者;someone;_Old man_ . . . _sun_. This key word looks to be difficult because of its proximity to _somebody_. In fact, it is a very common kanji that will cause you no difficulty at all. Its meaning should be seen as the human referent for the abstract noun  "something.";* As a primitive it means a _puppet_ -on-a-string.;1) [[Shizuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru)] 24-8-2007(196): I find the best way of memorizing this kanji is in conjunction with the Japanese compound for **ninja** : 忍者 – i.e. **someone** who **endures** (see FRAME 597 for the kanji 忍 ).

I'll use this to distinguish the kanji from other keywords like "inscription" that suggest a written name. Here I have a public-service station where residents can get a new **signature** , in calligraphy form. There are two sizes : big and small. The big one is made by the _cyclops_ , and the small one by the _puppet_. So that's where you find this unlikely duo: at the **signature** public-service station.

(see the ninja clinging to the roof and spying on a conversation, preparing to recite what he heard later).;5) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 17-5-2006(28): Imagine a wacky _variety_ show on TV (i.e. _talk_ show) where _puppets_ are invited to _talk_ about **various** topics.

To add to JetSetArnett's: at the _school_ , the **trees** outside are a popular place for the students to **mingle**.;5) [[cornrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cornrow)] 5-12-2008(37): I " _WOOD MINGLE_ ", but I have an **exam**.

足;leg;_Mouth_ . . . _mending_.

As a primitive, the image of a pirate can easily stand for the _wooden **leg**_. As for this kanji, I think James Heisig provided a story, which worked well enough for me.;4) [[zwarte_kat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zwarte_kat)] 12-2-2009(8): I'm gonna mend your mouth with my 3rd **leg** ,).;5) [[Viking101](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101)] 5-1-2010(5): I picture Seamus, the peg- **leg** sailor from Family Guy.

Ever since the accident, she's been completely irrational. I had to break up with her, so I drove out a few states away and called her from a public phone. Naturally she flipped out, and out of nowhere came this _gigantic wooden leg_ aimed straight at the telephone booth. Thankfully I jumped out before the leg pulverized the phone booth, but good thing I broke up with her with a **long-distance** call instead of in person.

The key words are _leg_ … _religion_.;5) [[CasualTatsumaki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki)] 21-10-2010(9): The disappearance 失踪 しっそう of the pirate, leaving nothing but footprints and a _wooden leg_ , inspired a strange new _religion_ about Bluebeard's resurrection and ascension.
骨;skeleton;This kanji and primitive refers to the _part of the body_ composed of the bones and their joints.

In this facility are many functions such as restaruants, sports areas, rooms, halls etc. which can eventually be used in forming kanji in the future.

In 4 cases (nos. 323, 1327, 1328, 2920) _crown_ is above _human legs_ , and in the other 3 (1888, 2472, 2679) one leg passes through the crown. I call the 1st pattern " _Miss World_ " (who is wearing a _crown_ & has long _human legs_ ) and the 2nd " _garter_ " (one _human leg_ passes through the _crown_ wearing it as a _garter_ ). Story: _Miss World_ has climbed a _tree_ to avoid the _finger_ that was **groping** for her. ( 探 means "grope for", i.e. search).;3) [[Zarxrax](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zarxrax)] 31-5-2008(69): (based on gorgon's story) a pictograph of a japanese schoolgirl getting **grope** d by perverts on the train. The _fingers_ of course, a _crown_ (her too short skirt) and her _legs_ below.

But because he is blind, he must use brail books, you know, the ones that have been PAPER PUNCHED on PAPER (wood). Naturally, he uses his FINGERS for this.
深;deep;Water . . . paper punch . . . tree.;;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 12-9-2006(277): If the groper's _"tree"_ goes up the girl's _miniskirt_ too **deep** , he'll ejaculate _fluid_.

丘;hill;Since this supposedly pictographic representation of a hill looks like anything but, picture a row of _axes_ driven into the ground up to their heads, and see if that doesn't present a more memorable image of **hill** \- at least a riskier one sliding down!;;1) [[Spidercat](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Spidercat)] 18-2-2008(284): Excalibur is the sword planted in a rock.

岳;Point;Think of the key word as referring to proper names of mountains, but do not confuse with _mountain pass_ (Frame 835).

We'll call it 'Fireman's **Point** '.;2) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 4-12-2006(103): This actually means a high mountain. So, to cater to the keyword, it's surely obvious (ahem) that if something gets such a fine title as **Point** , it must be more magnificent than the average mountain. It's as if there was a hill on top of an average mountain, adding to its height.;3) [[Pauline](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Pauline)] 3-7-2006(29): There's a movie called "The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain". The story is that English cartographer says that the mountain near a Welsh village is actually a hill (too low for a mountain), but the locals decide to make it a mountain (by making it higher). Let's say that in the end the _hill_ got the title **Point** to mark it as a _mountain_.;4) [[Viking101](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Viking101)] 8-1-2010(19): I chopped off the **point** of the _mountain_ with my _axe_.

糸;thread;Remember when your granny used to ask you to bend your arms at the _elbows_ and hold them out so that she could use them like a rack to hold a skein of string or yarn (here **thread** ) while she rolled it up into a _little_ ball? Now can you see the two _elbows_ (with the second stroke doubling up) at the top, and the character for _little_ below?;;1) [[lerris](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lerris)] 3-7-2007(195): I also went with Spiderman. However, in the cases where this primitive appears under other primitives, as opposed to on the left (I think there are ~5 times in this chapter) I've opted to use a similar character: Venom. This helps keep the positioning clear, especially on such characters as [dainty](../v4/1363.html) (#1363 細) and [accumulate](../v4/1364.html) (#1364 累).;2) [[Piitaa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Piitaa)] 17-7-2006(81): You'll be seeing this one a lot.

He's a very memorable character, and don't forget that he can shoot strings from both arms. What happens to the relative primitive when Spiderman comes along? If you can clearly picture his **thread** s winding, pulling, yanking, sticking to, filling, tying, and strangling objects, then you'll never confuse this primitive with another one.;5) [[aphasiac](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aphasiac)] 13-10-2009(16): Hate to be pedantic, but it's spelt _Spider-man_ , not _Spiderman_. Stan Lee added the hyphen to differentiate him from _Superman_..

Luckily, as he can shoot out threads **darning** is very easy for him to do.;2) [[Rakushun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Rakushun)] 7-7-2007(60): **Darning** is too obscure a word for me, I prefer to just think of it as repair. And obviously, repairing someones broken cloth things is a virtuous thing to do, and you need thread to do it.;3) [[cheechuan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cheechuan)] 19-3-2008(49): _Spiderman_ is of course _virtuous_ and spends a lot of time **darning** his costume after battles so that his privates don't show.;4) [[akimoto](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akimoto)] 1-3-2007(24): **Darning** socks instead of buying new ones shows the virtousness of the person - it exhibits the Japanese virtue of thrift (the Meiji emperor would refuse to buy new boots, constantly having them repaired.

Definition: abundant or lush in growth, as vegetation.

But if you don't care about the real origins and formation, either way of thinking of it works ^-^. (Source: <http://tinyurl.com/oj4jes> \+ <http://tinyurl.com/rcmnss>). **Story:** To have **courage** is to _run through_ (甬) with _power_. When that happens, a マ becomes a man ( 男 ). (Thx Captal).

(Note: New primitive: chop-seal + utilize = pogo stick. Because a _chop-seal_ is long and thin with a rubbery bit at the end. If it were big enough, you could _utilize_ it as a _pogo stick_ ).

(See my note at [traffic](../v4/1408.html) (#1408 通) for _pogo stick_ ). EDIT (2 years later): Keyword "jump" leads to confusion later on (see cjon256's post), **"Dancing"** would be better (but be sure to keep it distinct from [dance](../v4/1774.html) (#1774 舞)). New Story: I was no good at **dancing** due to my _wooden leg_ … until I had it fitted with a _pogo stick_!;3) [[cjon256](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cjon256)] 27-6-2006(54): This is totally wrong. It doesn't mean "jump", it means "dance"! 踊 [jump](../v4/1409.html) (#1409 踊) and 曜 [leap](../v4/1285.html) (#1285 躍) are homonyms, so it is easy to become permanently confused about which one DOES NOT mean "jump/leap". Caveat Lector! Note: 舞 [dance](../v4/1774.html) (#1774 舞) is quite a bit rarer (and not a homonym).;4) [[MeisterLlama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/MeisterLlama)] 29-4-2009(40): Heisig is triiippppiiiin'. This means dance, not **jump**. I named the other "dance" kanji "interpretive dance" because it is used in all sorts of concepts figuratively related to dance, like stages, fluttering, etc. One of my _legs is wooden_ , the other is a _pogo stick_. Surprisingly, I'm actually a pretty good at **dancing**.;5) [[Shizuru](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shizuru)] 27-8-2007(19): My wooden leg has a chop-seal at the end, but I have to **jump** so as to utilize it (so the chop-seal hits the right spot from above).

You must then _hanko_ ( _seal_ ) a document to say you’ve received both these items, only after which will they let you enter the _zoo_.

Just rename the keyword to PEPPER TREE (so you don't need a story) and move on.

So: the _false_ **wall** led to a secret lair under _ground_.

According to Rikichan, this is bi (ancient Chinese artifact, flat jade or glass disc with a circular hole in the centre).

It's a fine balance.;4) [[jimitha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha)] 10-10-2009(20): A rare instance in which Heisig made a mistake in the primitives. The bottom is not _spicy_ , because there is no _vase_ or _standing_ here–the first horizontal stroke of the "vase" is too long. Rather, this is _soil_ and a new primitive below, which we shall call a garden-variety _goat_. It's like the _mountain goat_ in frame 1959, just not in the mountains.

兼;concurrently;At the top we have _the animal horns_ and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one _rake_ with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure.

The force of each charging bull causes the tips of each staff to split again ( _split bottom of each rake handle_ ).;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 12-1-2008(68): You decide to take the bull by the _horns_ and do both chores **concurrently** , grabbing your _double-handled rake_ before attempting to clean up both your's and your neighbours' garden.

西;west;To our way of counting directions, the **west** always comes fourth. So it is convenient to find the character for _four_ in this kanji. But since we want only _one_ of the _four_ directions, the **west** adds the _one_ at the top and sucks the _human legs_ a bit out of their _mouth_ in the process.;* As a primitive, the meaning of _west_ can be expanded to refer to the _Old West_ of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for _east_ was expanded into _the East_. Note, however, that in its primitive form the _legs_ are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the _mouth_. Hence, we get the shape ⻃. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.;1) [[guidedog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/guidedog)] 9-2-2007(224): The old **west** represented by a completely empty whiskey bottle (compare [sign of the bird](../v4/1427.html) (#1427 酉) whiskey bottle about one third full).;2) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 3-3-2008(49): Note: this kanji is also used to denote Spain.;3) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 22-12-2008(25): The Spaghetti **Western** movies, typified by _empty bottles of whisky_ , were so- called because it was often an Italian director that shot them.

Although (as wrightak said) this kanji really refers to the hips, Heisig clearly chose the keyword 'loins' because it was anatomically close enough, and the primitives lent themselves to an easy-to- remember story. Just because you're all sexually repressed doesn't mean other people won't benefit from a story such as "the _part of the body_ people _need_ more than any other are the **loins** ".;3) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 6-3-2007(51): My **loins** ache!

門;gates;The pictograph of two swinging **gates** is so clear in this kanji that only its stroke order needs to be memorized.

The **gates** usually serve as an enclosure, and are written BEFORE whatever it is they enclose.;* As a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of _gates_ , but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for _door_.;1) [[dukelexon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dukelexon)] 16-1-2008(175): Heisig's stroke order in the 4th edition (and earlier) is wrong, so be careful – first is the left-most vertical stroke, then draw the rest of the "sun" attachment as you would normally.

閣;tower;Gates . . . each.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 18-1-2007(150): To keep this distinct from other kanji such as "watchtower" and "pagoda", I use the mnemonic " _towering **tower**_ ". – In some old 8-bit kung-fu videogame, with a plot similar as Bruce Lee's last, unfinished movie, the hero must break through a _gate_ at _each_ level of the **tower** ing **tower** , fighting with opponents using various styles of kung-fu until he meets the finale at the topmost level of the "towering **tower** ".;2) [[Proxx](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Proxx)] 27-11-2007(65): Remember the two **tower** s from lord of the rings… _each_ has it's own - very difficult to master - entrance _gate_.;3) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 9-7-2009(49): _Each lesbian_ waits for her turn with "the **tower** ".;4) [[walexander5](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/walexander5)] 6-9-2008(44): There is a **tower** on each side of the gate, they are posts for archers.;5) [[kumakuma](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kumakuma)] 15-7-2008(18): Since **tower** confuses me too much with other Kanji, I will use (political) CABINET instead, where this Kanji is frequently used.

倉;godown;The single _gate_ is used here not in order to represent one _gate_ , but many of them, indeed a _meeting of gates_. Add _mouth_ (as an entrance here) and you end up with **godown**.

The front of this **godown** is a " _meeting of small gates_ ", i.e. a row of gates through which goods come in and out. The _mouth_ can be an opening somewhere in the back, or the top, where cranes lift down the goods.;3) [[cangy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cangy)] 27-3-2008(48): **Note:** this is not _gate_ but actually a variation of _door_ and is written as such, with the vertical stroke last not first.;4) [[matsuyamakiwi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/matsuyamakiwi)] 29-6-2008(30): Imagine a mafia **godown** at the docks where shifty mafia types _meet_ and lots of dodgy deals **godown**.

勅;imperial order;In order to keep this character distinct from that for an _imperial edict_ (Frame 366), we must draw again on a pun.

It should be obvious but somehow I didn't notice it when I learned that one yesterday. v__v.;4) [[Nuriko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko)] 14-4-2008(51): A little kid about age 3 is **coloring** something that his teacher can't quite make out. It's just kind of a blob… an unknown shape. She asks, "What's that?" Of course, the child expects the teacher to know what it is and is offended that she didn't recognize what the shape/blob was. "Don't you see it's a vulture in a tree!?" Obviously very upset by this, the child's next drawing is of the vulture flying down from the tree and pecking the teacher to death.;5) [[meolox](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/meolox)] 23-11-2009(45): When **coloring** something in you _grab_ the crayon of choice to fill in the _shape_ s.

However the kanji is not common, so getting the exact meaning is not a big deal.;4) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 11-9-2007(30): YOU have the **patent** for _Playdoh_? That's **patent** ly false. See here, I have the _badge_ of proof issued from the **patent** office.;5) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 31-3-2008(24): It was **patent** ly absurd when the fellow tried to arrest me–his _badge_ was the wrong _shape_ : a _vase_ and a _sunflower_?

There is a different kanji for that meaning ( 腫れる ). This kanji means **swell** as in, a tire **swell** ing/expanding, your income **swell** ing/expanding, dough **swell** ing/expanding, etc. Johnskb's story is best b/c it does not involve **swell** ing in the sense of inflammation, just general expansion of the stomach. STORY: "If a PART OF your BODY begins to **SWELL** /EXPAND and resembles the SHAPE of a bass DRUM, you’re either pregnant or in desperate need of a diet.".;4) [[blackstockc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/blackstockc)] 9-3-2008(22): Which part of your body can change shape and, when it does, **swell** s up and throbs like a drumb?

Anyway, they travel by night, so they're just these three shapes moving through the gloom. They can't see well, so a St. Bernard dog noses their elbows whenever they start to go the wrong way.;5) [[DrJones](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/DrJones)] 19-3-2008(32): Hint: This is the humble/old kanji of the verb "to go/to come", and also is the kanji for "three" on legal documents.

"I'll be back, I'd like to take a quick stroll in the rain!' S/he said, and casually strolled off holding the umbrella (pictograph - you can see the umbrella over Mystique).;4) [[harusame](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/harusame)] 15-6-2009(26): It's **rare** to see the _king_ carrying his own _parasol_ \- typically he gets one of his attendants to do it for him (thanks to Katsuo for _umbrella + shape = parasol_ and to Peppi for the story idea).;5) [[Thunderball](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Thunderball)] 31-10-2007(22): The ancient _jewel_ that is _shaped_ like an _umbrella_ is extremely **rare** , and so is hung from the chin (ちん) of the royal _king_ of Mezura (めずら) to signify his importance.

文;sentence;Under the familiar _top hat_ we see a crisscross pattern or design, like that found on woodwork or garments. This should make an ugly enough image to help remember it.

並;row;This character represents a slightly stylized duplication of the kanji for _stand up_. By lengthening the sixth and seventh strokes, you will see how this is done.;* The primitive meaning remains the same as that of the kanji, but special attention has to be given to the varieties of shape this element can undergo. It is the most difficult one you will meet in this book. When it appears BENEATH its relative primitive, the top three strokes are omitted, though the third horizontal stroke may be doubled up with the bottom horizontal stroke of the element above it. ATOP its relative primitive, it can keep its kanji shape. When it does not, the top three strokes are removed and all of them are replaced BELOW the primitive's bottom line. We shall acknowledge this latter transformation by changing its meaning to _upside down in a row_.;1) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 8-6-2007(290): This is a simplification of 竝, a ideogram of _two_ people _standing_ in a **row**.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 12-1-2006(53): Hint : as a primitive I use the image of a **row** ing boat. In a **row** ing boat people sit in **row** s, but also side-by-side (another meaning of the kanji), working together (yet another meaning of this kanji). Note : there will also be a kanji for "rowboat" coming at frame 1876. The **row** ing boat is associated with the sport, and is a primitive, while the kanji for "rowboat" has a generic meaning of "a small boat". In any case, the kanji for "rowboat" will not appear as a primitive in the book.;3) [[bkvogel](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bkvogel)] 17-9-2008(37): Roman numeral II with 2 **row** s of animal horns.;4) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 18-7-2009(22): **Full form:** The image of a _viking longboat_ has the advantage of being both a pictograph and lending to the idea of _rowing_. **Flattened form:** Here, we simply take the action of _rowing_ , already reinforced by the previous image. **Upside-down-in-a-row form:** The horns on the top of this form follows the other forms as an image of a _Viking Berserker_ with his horned helmet.;5) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 14-7-2007(15): Pictograph of the standing **row** in a theatre. // Primitive: a **row** of standing penguins (since they can't sit). If it's in the top position, the penguins are in a **row** in a balcony above the stage. If it's in the bottom position, the penguins are in the front **row** , lower than the stage. If the top 3 strokes are moved to the bottom ("upside down in a **row** "), then the penguins are in a **row** doing headstands.

共;together;_Salad_ . . . _animal legs_.;* The primitive retains the meaning of _together_. Imagine things _strung together_ like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with _bushel basket_ , this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.;1) [[Django](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Django)] 1-10-2007(256): The character for [deluge](../v4/1799.html) (#1799 洪) gave me the idea to use **together** as a primitive for _Noah's Ark_.

Well, unless you like to eat chicken **WING** S alot.;3) [[LazyNomad](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/LazyNomad)] 9-7-2009(41): This is つばさ. To make a distinct image you can think about aircraft **wing** for which this kanji is also used. _Feathers_ would be extremely _uncommon_ to use in design of an aircraft **wing** s.;4) [[captal](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/captal)] 16-6-2008(24): When we talk about **wing** s and **feathers** we usually talk about 羽 , but the more **uncommon** form is つばさ for larger **wing** s- like angels - quite **uncommon** beings.;5) [[rich_f](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rich_f)] 10-3-2008(21): Reki's **wing** _feathers_ were an _uncommon_ color among haibane–they were black instead of white.

I sort of imagine a TED conference with cavemen discussing the **wheel** with a 2001 Space Oddesy-esc transition to Henry Ford also at a TED conference.

盤;tray;Carrier . . . dish.;;1) [[johnskb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/johnskb)] 17-5-2006(288): What do you call a "CARRIER" of DISHes? A **TRAY**.;2) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-2-2006(35): Imagine a restaurant set in Disney's Fantasia or maybe in Harry Potter's university, where _dishes_ are magically landing and taking off of a _carrier_ **tray**.;3) [[SimHuman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SimHuman)] 16-1-2010(20): "This, my friend, is no run of the mill dish!

瓜;melon;The only thing that distinguishes this from the _claw_ is the addition of the _elbow_ , made by doubling up the third stroke and adding a fourth.;;1) [[yorkii](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/yorkii)] 8-7-2006(312): 何これ ???? ok, sorry to be crude… if you claw at a girls **melon** s, she is gonna give you the elbow.;2) [[Christoph](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Christoph)] 14-2-2007(62): M for **melon**. 瓜 elon.;3) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 25-8-2007(33): Vegetarian _vultures_ are fighting for a **melon** , each trying to _elbow_ its way to it with _claws_.;4) [[imojyochu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/imojyochu)] 3-1-2009(25): The housewives _CLAW_ ed and _ELBOW_ ed each other to buy the first **MELON** of the season.;5) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 2-1-2007(15): To top yorkii's crudeness: while girls have juicy **melon** s on them, they are well protected with claws and elbows.

繭;cocoon;Though it's a good thing that the primitive for **cocoon** has been radically abbreviated from this, its full form as a kanji, the story it holds is a charming one. The silkworm ( _insect_ ) eats the leaves of the mulberry bush (the _flowers_ ), digests them and transforms them into _thread_ with which it spins about itself, in mystic wisdom, its own coffin (the _hood_ ). The dividing line that separates the two elements helps the picture of the little worm cutting itself off from contact with the outside world, but as a character stroke, it is a clear exception.;;1) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 27-7-2008(190): This is a simple two-column manga showing the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a **cocoon**. First, the caterpillar gets under a large flower (bees tend to hang around flowers, which scare away other predators). Then, in the first frame, we see the caterpillar ( _insect_ ). Then, a bar separating this frame from the next frame (remember that Japanese manga run the other way!), in which we see the _insect_ covered with _thread_ , making a beautiful **cocoon**.;2) [[eightyd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd)] 15-8-2009(172): I dont like lesson 51 so far.;3) [[gdaxeman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/gdaxeman)] 14-1-2008(82): The magic _flower_ is the reason why _Spider-Man_ ended up miniaturized and confined inside a _hood_ -like **cocoon** together with an _insect_. Now, only a _walking stick_ separates them both.;4) [[Alucard](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Alucard)] 19-1-2007(45): See book, one of the good stories you can remember from there.;5) [[mattimus](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mattimus)] 20-11-2009(31): _Spider-Man_ bent over to pick up a pretty _flower_ when a giant _glass hood_ dropped over him- it's a trap! Now he's stuck inside, fending off a swarm _insect_ with his _walking stick_ as they try to wrap him in a **cocoon**. Could this be the end of _Spider-Man_?!

(shaydwyrm).;3) [[zazen666](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/zazen666)] 11-10-2007(29): The resturant I worked at had no real **benefit** s (vaction time, sick leave, etc), except for one-free meals. However, the meals sucked. Basically, we were given left overs, consiting of _animal horns, and animal legs_ , on a plain _dish_.;4) [[mr_hans_moleman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mr_hans_moleman)] 15-12-2008(22): Friends with **BENEFIT** S, is basically a HORNY friend who spreads their LEGS and offers themselves on a silver PLATE.;5) [[lisbet](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/lisbet)] 6-1-2012(17): ( ノಠ益ಠ )ノ彡┻━┻ THEESH KANJI HAS NO **BENEFIT** TO ME!!!!!!!!! RAGE!!!!!!
暇;spare time;The element for _day_ on the left is logical enough. Next to it we see _staples_ being held in _mouth_ (one stroke is doubled up), indicating working in one's hobby or handicrafts at home on one's **spare time**. The small _box_ at the top right is facing backwards, or more properly  "inside out." Finally, we have the _crotch_ at the bottom.;;1) [[Zareon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon)] 5-4-2007(314): Some jackass-like people have way too much **spare time**. You can find video's of them all over the internet, if you like such things, you can watch it all _day_. You see them _stapling_ their _mouths_ shut, or throwing eachother _upside down in boxes_ or kicking each other in the _crotch_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 14-2-2008(94): Tip: The complex right side of this kanji appears twice more in Heisig. He later names it "hobby". REF: [shrimp](../v4/2689.html) (#2689 蝦), [haze](../v4/2779.html) (#2779 霞).;3) [[snallygaster](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/snallygaster)] 18-6-2008(48): I avoid using "mouth" here because it makes me mess up the stroke order. Instead I use a flag/staple combo. Hopefully you've seen the Justin Timberlake "dick in a box" spoof. Someone has a lot of **spare time** , so he decides to spend the _day_ making an especially elaborate dick in a box. There's a _flag_ _stapled_ to the box as decoration (like wrapping paper). He rigs it up so he can instantly flip the _box inside-out_ to reveal his _crotch_. Well, it's a vivid image once you get it. He's my hero.;4) [[Peppi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi)] 17-9-2009(23): A pervert's **hobby** (see Katsuo): He turns _two boxes_ upside-down ("コ") and _staples_ them together - that makes them look like a bench. Then he hides in it and waits until some girls come and sit down. What can he see? Of course their _crotches_! If he does that all _day_ he won't have **spare time** for anything else.;5) [[inaka_rob](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/inaka_rob)] 17-4-2012(13): WARNING EXPLICIT!!! In my **spare time** , basically all DAY long, I STAPLE a few things to the wall. a picture of a woman's mouth and outward facing "box". I think you know what I do with my crotch.

The _taskmaster_ profiteerer forces you to find them all using a _compass_.;2) [[Harrow](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Harrow)] 23-3-2009(129): Instead of being glued to one [specialty](../v4/46.html) (#46 専) 専 , I decided to **spread** my attention in many directions 方 , and be a taskmaster at none.;3) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 17-7-2007(67): Gory story: Instead of _setting you free_ , the taskmaster said "Spread em!", raped you, and drove an _arrowhead_ into your _brain_.;4) [[sarek05](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sarek05)] 14-10-2008(36): I assasinated the _taskmasker_. When the arrowhead hit his _brain_ , bits and pieces **spread** out in all _directions_.;5) [[karmatheif](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/karmatheif)] 19-1-2010(13): This is the （しき）used in ふろしき 風呂敷 , which is when the Japanese bundle something in a large cloth, then gather the ends togther and tie it at the top to carry it around. Story: Imagine an eccentric _taskmaster_ who feels the need to carry a gigantic ふろしき everywhere for his picnics, so he can **spread** it in all _directions_ , cover a whole _field_ and pins the corners to the ground with stone _arrowheads_.
来;come;This odd but common kanji is built up of the character for _not yet_ into which a pair of _animal horns_ has been inserted.;;1) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 22-2-2007(346): You _horny_ bastard, don't **come** , at least _not yet_!;2) [[volfy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/volfy)] 12-5-2006(72): When I **come** home, there's nobody and no dinner waiting for me. Sigh… _rice_ for _one_ again.;3) [[dilandau24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dilandau24)] 19-4-2007(55): Here I see, of all things, Bambi. His _animal horns_ have _not yet_ **come** out. (As we can see in the kanji, the _animal horns_ are not at the top, not "poking through". ) Remember: Bambi will soon **come** to have a great set of _animal horns_ but they have _not yet_ **come** out.;4) [[billyclyde](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/billyclyde)] 13-10-2007(14): Last words of the Bible: "Come, Lord Jesus, **come**." The Devil pokes his HORNS up and says: NOT YET!;5) [[baylin](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/baylin)] 7-8-2009(9): One bowl of rice comin' up.
気;spirit;The **spirit** in this character refers to the changeable moods and airs of one's personality as well as to the more essential combination of vital forces that distinguish things and individuals one from the other. Its elements are: _reclining_ . . . _floor_ . . . _fishhook_ . . . _sheaf_. Do not confuse with _spirits_ (Frame 1930).;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 17-4-2007(130): _Captain Hook_ , his **spirit** crushed, is lying on the ground cursing _Wolverine_ who has defeated him with his far superior claws.;2) [[Balaam](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Balaam)] 2-2-2008(57): You're reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you've been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning **spirit**.;3) [[mantixen](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mantixen)] 11-7-2009(34): _Wolverine_ has a fighting **spirit** , and even while _reclining_ on the _floor_ sharpens the _hooks_ on his claws.;4) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 30-5-2006(27): Hint : the first four strokes may be seen as _Captain Hook_ : _reclining on the floor_ , shaking his _hook_ in the air and moaning "Peter Pan! Why did you elude me again! Whyyy!". Se here we have Captain Hook having one of his fits, and about the only thing that will bring him his **spirit** back is a _sheaf_. The last part probably won't make sense but I am French speaking and somehow I settled onto the image of a "bouquet" of flowers for the word "sheaf".;5) [[Hujis](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Hujis)] 22-5-2009(18): Someone is _lying_ on the _floor_ , a huge _x_ ripped into their stomach with a _fishhook_.

飛;fly;The two _large hooks_ have little propellers (the two _drops_ on each _hook_ ) attached to them for **flying**. Beneath is the _measuring box_ , which serves as the body of this **flying** contraption. The stroke order will cause some problems, so take care with it.;;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 1-1-2007(267): Hooks with small wings attached look like hummingbirds with a long beak.

Ouch!;5) [[ktcgx](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ktcgx)] 3-12-2012(8): I learnt this Kanji a long time ago, when I was a kid, and the image I had for it is so vivid it's served me well, and I thought I'd share it. This Kanji is _two hummingbirds_ **fly** ing over a field of _asparagus stalks_. But one flew too low, and got its beak stuck through two stalks.
沈;sink;The technique for **sinking** used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a _crown_ tied about one _leg_ before the unfortunate party is tossed into the _water_.;;1) [[jreaves](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jreaves)] 20-7-2007(178): (thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she **sink** s.

衰;decline;Let this key word connote the **decline** and fall of the Roman Empire. It shows a fellow in a _top hat_ and _scarf_ , trying hard to look happy by putting a _walking stick_ in his _mouth_ sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.;;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 2-1-2007(385): If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven't seen him after his **decline**.

衷;inmost;Between the _top hat_ and the _scarf_ you will see the character for _in_ which is truncated at the bottom so as not to interfere with the _scarf_.

Is written _one_ , _mouth_ , _walking stick_ , _scarf_ , with 9 strokes. [It evolved from a combination of _garment_ and _in_ (meaning undergarments), so maybe it used to be written as described in the book…].;5) [[SammyB](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/SammyB)] 22-10-2008(11): The _pathetic_ emo guy is always talking about his **inmost** feelings. Sometimes I want to shove a _walking stick_ in his _mouth_ to stop him talking.
面;mask;Imagine a **mask** over your head with _eyes_ peeping out from all over the head, a _hundred_ in all (the element for _eye_ displacing the fifth stroke of that for _hundred_ ).;;1) [[Zactacular](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zactacular)] 4-10-2007(147): When Jim Carrey puts on **The **Mask**** , he can make it seem like he has _100 eyes_ popping out of his head.;2) [[phauna](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/phauna)] 27-2-2008(106): If you're wearing a **mask** , a _hundred_ _eyes_ can look at you but none of them will know who you are.;3) [[Monkeys_Spiders](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Monkeys_Spiders)] 18-2-2010(46): I see this as the comb primitive combined with the kanji for 3 giving the same stroke order :).

Flowers must first be _completely soaked in water_ , and then poured over a thin piece of _flooring_ under which there is an _oven fire_.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 25-3-2008(136): Note: _complete + water + floor_ are later combined into 丞 [helping hand](../v4/2919.html) (#2919 丞). Story: The driver of a **steam** train asks you for a _helping hand_ and explains that your job is to throw _flowers_ on the _fire_ to make the **steam**.;3) [[crystalcastlecreature](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/crystalcastlecreature)] 14-10-2009(63): (EASY KANJI!) At the top we see hot **steam** forming FLOWERS. At the bottom we see the STOVE FIRE heating the bottom of a pan. So what's in the middle causing all this **steam**? Its all COMPLETELY WATER.;4) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 28-4-2008(31): I keep forgetting this primitive, so _completely_ / _water_ for me will be a sort of _water sprite_ or elemental, a _child-like_ creature _completely_ made of _water_. ——– It used to be thought that to create **steam** , you had to trap the _water sprite_ (using some sort of magical _flowers_ as a lure), and place them over a thin piece of _flooring_ under which there's an _oven fire_. The **steam** then _flowers_ from the _water sprite_ (re: fuaburisu).;5) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 10-12-2006(16): When you want to **steam** some _flowers/vegetation_ you don't cover them _completely_ with _water_ , rather you have just a little at the _floor_ of the saucepan and then _heat_.
承;acquiesce;The sense of passive acceptance or reception of information is contained in this key word. The form is based on the middle portion of the preceding character, with three additional strokes, best thought of as the kanji for _three_.;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 14-3-2007(222): To get someone to _completely_ **acquiesce** it takes _3_ dunks in the _water_ before they give.;2) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 25-10-2007(87): To get someone to **acquiesce** , duck them _completely_ in _aqua_ (= _water_ ) _three_ times. (variation on dingomick's).;3) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 8-7-2008(42): Warning, Obscene!! I finally got my girl to **acquiesce** to a lewd act.. But it took _3 times_ to get it in _completely_ and lots of _water_ to clean up afterwards.;4) [[nest0r](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/nest0r)] 28-4-2008(17): You must ask the trapped _water sprite_ not once, not twice, but _thrice_ (a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" comes to mind) before it will **acquiesce** to your requests. It's not for any mystical reasons, it's just that it hates being asked the same thing _three_ times, like that character from Austin Powers.;5) [[koohiikun](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/koohiikun)] 30-11-2009(16): Waterboarding: To _completely_ **acquiesce** it usually takes just _three_ sessions with _water_. (Thanks to dingomick for the idea.).
函;bin;This is the character from which the element for _shovel_ derives. Within it comes the element for _snare_ , with the _sparkler_ surrounding it.;;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 1-7-2007(206): Damn racoons ill show them. I put a snare in the **bin** as well as a few phosphorous sparklers so as to scare the shit out of the buggers as they rummage through my **bin**.;2) [[smujohnson](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/smujohnson)] 2-3-2009(135): (thegeezer3) Damn racoons… I'll show them. I'll put a SNARE in the **BIN** as well as a few SPARKLERS so as to scare the shit out of the buggers, then hit them with a SHOVEL.;3) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 12-6-2007(40): A typical German apartment has five different kind of trash **bin** s: paper, plastic, glass, biodegradable, and everything else. Don't you dare throw your trash in the wrong **bin** , or else you'll find yourself on the wrong side of a booby trap: hung by a _snare_ , burned by _sparklers_ , and knocked out cold by a _shovel_.;4) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 24-12-2006(25): (Reformatted from erikkusan) The Windows Recycle **Bin** is like a _snare_ holding onto your trash. When you empty it, a window displays little _sparkles_ as the files are _shoveled_ off of your hard drive.;5) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 2-1-2007(14): This is alternative way of writing 箱 , used in e.g. 函館 (はこだて) and sometimes as is. This **bin** is actually a snare with a powerful sparkler in it that kills rats that enter it, the remains of which are then shoveled away (to a "recycle **bin** " perhaps).
極;poles;The **poles** this key word refers to are the extremities of the earth or the terminals of an electric field. The elements are: _tree_ . . . _snare_ . . . _mouth_ . . . _crotch_ . . . _floor_.;;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 13-4-2007(362): Can simplify this using [decay](../v4/1243.html) (#1243 朽). Then: The expedition to the **poles** is bad for your health, and the _decay_ that started in your _mouth_ spreads to your _crotch_ – at which point you fall to the _floor_.;2) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 17-3-2008(101): (modified Katsuo) Can simplify this using [decay](../v4/1243.html) (#1243 朽). You travel to the _poles_ , a frozen wasteland. In desperate need of food you try to set up a snare but the tree is _decayed_ (see story for [decay](../v4/1243.html) (#1243 朽)) so you catch no prey. The brutal cold first attacks your _mouth_ as your lips turn blue, then your _crotch_ also gets cold as your body fails, finally you fall to the _floor_.;3) [[ayoung24](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ayoung24)] 24-12-2006(20): Santa Claus (from the North **Pole** , of course), has a _wooden_ sled led by reindeer _snared_ at the _mouth_. One unfortunate night, he jumps down a chimney and burns his _crotch_ on a piece of coal as he hits the _floor_.;4) [[akrodha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/akrodha)] 12-6-2007(7): The diverging magnetic fields at the **poles** actually attract cosmic radioactive _decay_ , particularly the kind that causes cancer in the lips or the testicles. But don't worry, you can protect either your _mouth_ or your _crotch_ by digging a hole in the _ground_ and covering it up. Which part do you protect? Imagine coming back home with cancer in the other, unprotected part.;5) [[Aeryon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Aeryon)] 16-1-2012(4): I remember sharing this joke on the playground back in 1986. "Did you ear about the dumb polak who climbed a tall tree to see both **poles**? On the way up, stepped in his own snare, fell to the floor and ended up with his crotch in his own mouth. Then he said seeing his own crotch in his mouth… that's not the pole I wanted to see!".
牙;tusk;If you play with this primitive's form with pencil and paper, you will see that it begins with a _box_ -like shape, and ends with the final two strokes of the _halberd_ , a convenient combination for the **tusk** protruding from the mouth of an animal.;* Since this kanji has 4 strokes, you would expect that as a primitive it would also have 4 - but in fact it has 5 in the following two frames (the second stroke between divided into 2 strokes) and reverts to 4 again in frame 2056.;1) [[chamcham](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/chamcham)] 20-12-2008(142): The kanji looks like an elephant with **tusk** s. the box is the elephant's eye. The final stroke is the **tusk**.;2) [[Copycatken](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Copycatken)] 2-7-2006(87): He stored the **tusk** s into a _box_ , along with the _broken halberds_.;3) [[stupiddog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog)] 28-12-2009(26): You can save yourself a lot of trouble because Heisig is correct on [tusk](../v4/1904.html) (#1904 牙) (4), [bud](../v4/1905.html) (#1905 芽) (8), [wicked](../v4/1906.html) (#1906 邪) (8) but not [gracious](../v4/1907.html) (#1907 雅) (5th edition says 12, but WWWJDIC says 13). So: In it's Kanji form, it has four (4) strokes, in it's primitive form (I suggest: ivory because that's what elephant **tusk** s are made of) it has always five (5) strokes for all Kanji in RTK1.;4) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 3-3-2008(21): The _waitress_ was charged by the elephant who skewered her legs with its **tusk** s. As a result her right leg had to be amputated ( _missing right leg_ ), her left leg is crippled, stiff, and limp ( _straight left leg_ ), and the **tusk** is still embedded in her left leg ( _final stroke attached to waitress's crippled left leg_ ).;5) [[Megaqwerty](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Megaqwerty)] 10-6-2007(13): This actually reminds me of _waitress_ more than anything, but that doesn't help much.
芽;bud;Flowers . . . tusk.;;1) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 25-12-2007(217): Zoo keepers are baffled as to why the tips of the elephant's _tusks_ keep **budding** into _flowers_.;2) [[Raichu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Raichu)] 22-10-2007(57): **Bud** s while they're still small tend to be tusk-shaped.;3) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 25-1-2008(31): An elephant places a big _flower_ on the other elephant's _tusks_ , to show they're best **bud** s.;4) [[stupiddog](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/stupiddog)] 28-12-2009(13): Unfortunately, this must be a sad story. Poachers lure the elefants with **buds** (of _flowers_ ) so they can kill them to get their _ivory_.;5) [[eightyd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/eightyd)] 5-4-2010(12): Lets smoke some flower **bud** out of my tusk bong.

(<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_EY4JYruC8>).;4) [[esaulgd](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/esaulgd)] 7-3-2009(17): You can see this is the city of the **wicked** just by the huge _tusks_ adorning the _city walls_.;5) [[jmcanally](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jmcanally)] 14-2-2010(12): Considered a **WICKED** trade by most of the modern world, the TUSK trade is still often carried out in the SLUMS, outside of the influence of the police and government.
雅;gracious;Tusk . . . an old turkey.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 16-7-2007(220): "Goodness **gracious**! Such an **elegant** _turkey with a tusk_." This mnemonic is meant to join RtK's keyword with a better proposition. Heisig could have used " **elegant** " here, which is not confounded so easily with [graceful](../v4/721.html) (#721 淑), and accurately represents the character's meaning (it is also the chosen keyword in Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary).;2) [[Zareon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Zareon)] 5-4-2007(47): To not confuse it with [grace](../v4/606.html) (#606 恩) or [graceful](../v4/721.html) (#721 淑), think of the phrase "Goodness **gracious**." Like: "Goodness **gracious**! A _turkey_ with _tusks_!".;3) [[aircawn](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/aircawn)] 13-2-2007(16): Be **gracious** around the large- _tusked turkey_.

A _turkey_ with _tusks_!" screamed the **elegant** lady walking through the GM farm.;5) [[torida](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torida)] 26-5-2010(8): WARNING: there's a kanji for [elephant](../v4/1976.html) (#1976 象). ………………………….. _Elephant Tusks_ are very **gracious** , _Turkey wattles_ aren't. ……………… <http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=turkey>+wattles .

"I have a good **explanation** for this. Really!".;2) [[Virtua_Leaf](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Virtua_Leaf)] 14-10-2009(103): **Animal track** primitive: As expected, **animal tracks** were left in place of the trail of _rice_ I'd purposely _drop_ ped the night before. EDIT - also try **the footprint** for a primitive meaning, the classic symbol of detective films. STORY: This _shakuhachi_ player is so talented, he can do **interpretation** s of animal noises too. They're so realistic he soon has _animal tracks_ leading straight to wherever he's playing.;3) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 4-1-2007(65): The magical shakuhachi can easily give explanation for any animal tracks, just like it can be used to translate words ( 訳 ).;4) [[Shibo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Shibo)] 22-6-2008(40): Mrs. Badger follows the _animal tracks_ to the den where she finds her husband getting _shakuhachi_ from a fox. Now, I don't speak badger but judging from the screeching and the gestures, my **interpretation** of the situation is that Mrs. Badger is not pleased. (thanks dingomick! Just trying to use this new keyword).;5) [[furrykef](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/furrykef)] 5-7-2008(17): An **interpretive** dance of some kind where somebody follows _animal tracks_ , a _shakuhachi_ providing the soundtrack, suggesting the tracker's thoughts and intentions.
番;turn;This key word has been chosen for its overlay of several meanings similar to those of the kanji: a **turn** of duty, a round, a number, and so forth. Its composite elements: _animal tracks_ . . . _rice field_.;* As a primitive element, we choose the image of a pair of _dice_ which it is your _turn_ to throw.;1) [[thegeezer3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thegeezer3)] 1-7-2007(211): The famers take it in **turn** s to watch out for any animal tracks on their rice field.;2) [[Biene](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Biene)] 4-5-2008(38): (modified thegeezer3) _Animal tracks_ were found in the _rice field_ , now the kids of the farmer take it in **turn** s to keep watch and hinder the animals to make more _animal tracks_ in their precious _rice field_.

This is perhaps the most common context in which this kanji is found, e.g. 1st, 2nd = [一番、二番](midori://search?text=一番、二番) . Story: I see _animal tracks_ leading to the _rice field_ and start to worry, but then see the **numerical order** in which the tracks are made: 一番 mouse tracks, 二番 cat tracks, 三番 dog tracks, then 四番 lion tracks. Looks like the rice is safe.;5) [[jimitha](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jimitha)] 3-11-2009(11): (I use _animal droppings_ instead of _animal tracks_ to avoid confusion.) Story: Workers slack off in the _rice field_ taking **turn** s at a dice game, using _animal droppings_ as the dice (for lack of other implements). What game are they playing? Craps, of course.

翻;flip;Dice . . . feathers.;;1) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 20-2-2008(170): Don't play _dice_ with birds.

To _flip_ an omelette, you need first some eggs. But you said it aloud, and when you go to the _field_ , you find it empty except for some _animal tracks_ and some missing _feathers_. The chickens have escaped!! _(music from "Chicken Run")_.;4) [[torabi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/torabi)] 1-6-2008(36): It's your _turn_ to **flip** the chicken _wings_ on grill.;5) [[RoboTact](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/RoboTact)] 28-8-2007(30): These are crooked _dice_ , modified using the latest robotic technology.

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_%28country_subdivision%29>.;2) [[Matthew](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Matthew)] 17-3-2009(132): In the particular **clan** depicted by this character, each member has to take his or her _turn_ _watering_ the _flowers_.;3) [[dwhitman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dwhitman)] 20-2-2008(83): Each member of the **clan** has to take his _turn_ at _water_ ing the _flowers_. The order they do it in is decided by a roll of the _dice_. (tweaked Matthew's story).;4) [[laxxy](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/laxxy)] 30-10-2006(27): This yakuza **clan** controls the "flower" trade, the 'water business' ( 水商 ) and the dice gambling.;5) [[erikkusan](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/erikkusan)] 5-4-2006(19): This is what members of Ku Klux **Clan** is doing when not meeting: pretending to live normal life by watering flowers during the day and playing dice-games with their families at night. What a double-life.
毛;fur;This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of _hand_ to produce **fur**. If you reverse your _hand_ and put its palm down, you will have the side on which **fur** grows.;;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 28-12-2006(179): I've heard of people having hair on the back of their hands, but this is ridiculous!

鬱;gloom;Learning this character will take a little doing. Before we start, it is a good idea to keep the key word distinct from _melancholy_ (Frame 663), with which it combines to create the psychological condition of depression (a metaphor based on the hollow or sinking of the material _depression_ we met in Frame 1421). The picture of **gloom** begins with a small _grove_ of trees, under which we see a _crown_ made out of used _tin cans_. Next (the lower half of the kanji) we find a combination that appears only a few times in modern characters and only once in those treated in the volumes of _Remembering the Kanji_. It is composed of a _shovel_ with a _sheaf_ dotted with small _drops_ on all sides. Think of it as a large scoop _shovel_ attached to the front of a bulldozer, whose driver is singing: ♪  "Bulldozing in the _sheaves_ , bulldozing in the _sheaves_... " ♪ The _drops_ represent the chaff flying about as the _sheaves_ are tossed about by the heavy machinery. There is _someone sitting on the ground_ alongside, watching as the machinery makes its way around the neighboring farmland - and it's you, wearing your _tin-can crown_. You feel overwhelmed by the impending doom as the invasion of agro- business draws closer and closer to the _grove_ , the only patch of woods that remains of what once was a vast forest. The whole scene represents a re- _shaping_ of the natural environment that brings the heavy weight of **gloom** down upon you. A bit much, perhaps, but there are enough elements to allow for any number of other combinations.;;1) [[mcbainpc](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/mcbainpc)] 26-4-2010(76): I'm depressed that this kanji has 29 strokes.;2) [[NeoGlitch](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/NeoGlitch)] 1-3-2012(49): In the middle of the GROVE you find a TIN CAN.

You turn back and it's WOLVERINE, with a SHOVEL on his back and all COVERED IN [rocksalt](../v4/2866.html) (#2866 鹵) "I found that crown in the rocksalt mines over there, so hand it over!" Unless you wanna die, you hand him the crown and he goes away.

In such cases it may be easier to use the same keyword, calling the other kanji "keyword (alt)". 鬱 is the more common of the two and is in the new Joyo kanji list.;5) [[thecite](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/thecite)] 14-11-2009(8): **Sulky** : let the bottom left 鬯 (rock salt + spoon) = salt shaker: The kid in the restaurant is **sulky** when the _salt shaker_ and _can_ of coke spills all over his cardboard ( _wooden_ ) birthday crown, creating a massively _shaped_ sticky puddle all over the floor.

This skunk, due to a random fluke, is not black and white, but actually silver colored. Which means this skunk can pass, say for, a cat (aka Over the Hedge). When the skunk realized the odd coloring wasn't a curse but actually a blessing, it realized in it's _heart_ that it could be **sociable** with all sorts of animals that normally would run away from smelly skunks.;4) [[radical_tyro](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/radical_tyro)] 20-7-2007(18): The skunk is very **sociable** at the party, telling everyone all about his _silver_ _heart_. // Primitive: top left: _skunk_ = a skunk _clawing_ at a _sow_.

馬;horse;Let the extra vertical stroke in the _mane_ combine with the first vertical stroke to give an image of the **horse's** long neck. The only odd thing is the _tail feathers_ at the end, but that should present a good image to remember the character by. The fact that the last stroke of _mane_ and the first of _tail feathers_ coincide should no longer surprise you.;* As a primitive, this kanji will mean a _team of horses_ as distinct from the single _horse_ whose primitive we met earlier.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 5-1-2007(124): Turkey with the drops at the top removed and tail feathers added (this matches stroke order and there are the tail feathers already, why not have the whole bird). If you take the two drops of 隹 as wings, then **horse** s are like turkeys, but have no wings and have more prominent tail "feathers".

As a primitive I used the theme of the _Trojan **Horse**_. Not the modern computer viruses, but the large wooden **horse** which led to the demise of Troy and of the Trojans. Either its size (much greater than a live **horse** ), or the fact that it conceals things into its belly, will set it appart from the _horse_ primitive that came in frame 568 ("noon").;4) [[Filip](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Filip)] 10-3-2008(24): 4 dots = 4 limbs, the hook = tail, top part = manes.;5) [[jotakami](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jotakami)] 7-4-2010(13): This kanji needs no mnemonic, really. It's used often enough as a primitive that you would have to have Alzheimer's to forget it. If you write each kanji once, as Heisig recommends, then the stroke order will also come naturally.
駒;pony;_Team of horses_ . . . _phrase_. In American slang, a **pony** is an underground translation of a classical text, which students who cannot manage the difficult _phrases_ of the original language consult and pass on from one generation to the next.;;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 23-4-2007(207): The cute little innocent-looking plastic **pony** on the desk of a student is in fact a _trojan horse_ , hiding _phrases_ in its belly which are used for cheating during an exam.

Can I have a **pony**?". Finally Marge snaps "No, not until you're older!" "But mum, it will be a _horse_ by then.".;5) [[rtkrtk](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/rtkrtk)] 17-3-2008(12): The **Pony** Express was a quick mail delivery service in old America. It actually used horses, not ponies, but the _phrase_ "Pony Express" sounded better than "Horse Express", and so they chose the better-sounding phrase as a marketing gimmick.

The British police are punching into the _trojan horse_ 's sides with an _awl_ , to try and find if it is concealing people. Of course they aren't going to find much by using an _awl_ for that purpose (the _awl_ having such a short tip), but the sillyness of it should be enough to remember it.;4) [[genbaku](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/genbaku)] 23-1-2008(13): Verify the horse is genuine by poking it with an awl.;5) [[to_nihon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/to_nihon)] 26-11-2008(11): They finally came up with a **verification** system to make sure that giant wooden horses weren't _trojan horses_. _Frankenstein_ comes up and slaps the hell out of the side of each wooden horse. If it's hollow and soldiers are discovered inside, the **verification** process is complete and the _trojan horse_ is destroyed before it's brought into the city.

虎;tiger;The kanji in this frame recalls the famous Bengali fable about the group of magicians (the _magic wand_ ) who decided to make a **tiger**. It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces ( _diced_ into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated **_tiger_** promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless _human legs_ ). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for _zoo_ (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the **tiger** somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for _zoo_.;* As a primitive element itself, the _human legs_ are also swallowed up, but the meaning of _tiger_ is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the _tiger_ something else to eat.;1) [[raulir](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/raulir)] 9-4-2007(122): Magic wand + first two strokes of pelt ( 皮 ) + diced + human legs. A wizard who turns people he doesn't like into newts with his magic wand goes for variety - he has always wanted a **tiger** pelt - but things go awry when the **tiger** promptly dices and eats him, leaving only a pair of legs.

鹿;deer;Drawn on the walls of a complex of _caves_ near Niaux in southern France are a number of animal likenesses dating from the Upper Paleolithic period. Among them we find pictures of **deer** , some of them showing men in **deer** masks. By _comparing_ their drawings to real **deer** , Stone Age people hoped to acquire power over the animal in the hunt, and by _comparing_ themselves to the **deer** , to take on that animal's characteristics. But time has locked with a "double- _key_ " (the extra stroke through the element for _key_ ) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings. But more important than the enigmas of the troglodytic mind is the way in which _caves_ , a double- _key_ , and _comparing_ gives us the kanji for **deer**.;* As a primitive, this kanji is abbreviated much the same as the _tiger_ was: the lower element is dropped to leave room for a replacement. Its meaning, however, remains the same. There are a very few cases (see frame 2158) in which there is no abbreviation. When this happens, we may keep the image suggested by the above explanation: _painting of a deer_.;1) [[synewave](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/synewave)] 1-5-2007(300): _Bambi_ wanders into a _cave_ and sees a _side order of salad_ and _2 spoons_ …but what's the main course?;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 26-4-2007(37): Santa's rein **deer** , Rudolf, opens a nightclub in a _cave_.

However, they are not well known for actually watching where the heck they are bounding about. Here we have a bunch of dead _deer_ bodies that you find at the **foot of a mountain**. You are trying to figure why there are so many dead _deer_ in one spot, and then you trace a line up the mountain - leaves and such are scattered all the way up…to a grove.

Bill squeezed her hand gently, "Do you feel it? The **connection**? It's… electric." The mammoth blushed, twinges of anticipation and fear coursing through her heart. Could they really start over? She didn't want to get hurt again, but the **connection** was still so deep, so real. She looked Bill in the eyes: "Don't you break my heart again Bill." "I love you, baby. Let's go back to my place. I'm going to get Pleistocene on your fat ass.".

An ogre or a troll would be a more fitting translation. Such a thing has but a drop of brains and uses its legs and elbows as deadly weapons (a concept which should be familiar from the [license](../v4/765.html) (#765 允) to kill). I'll use "ogre" for this.;5) [[cameron_en](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/cameron_en)] 3-11-2008(22): This **ghost** had only a _drop of brains_ , his _legs_ and _elbow_ were easily visible from under his sheet.

The top half of this character is the old form for the kanji in frame 575.;;1) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 14-1-2006(250): The top 16 strokes are the chinese radical for "dragon". Joining up both meanings of the radical we can name the top part of this kanji "imperial dragon". Two-headed snakes do exist as biological curiosities, and they look a bit like a _slingshot_ (with the heads splitting at a junction). Our _imperial dragon_ here, the pet of a Chinese emperor, is a rare "three-headed slingshot- snake" kept in a _vase_ and fed with _meat_. When the emperor **attack** ed neighbours, his army wore the _imperial dragon garment_.;2) [[jackswitch](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/jackswitch)] 31-3-2009(99): Fuaburisu's story is incredibly good, but I made it a bit simpler: The _imperial dragon_ is a rare " _three-headed slingshot-snake_ ", kept in a _vase_ and fed with _meat_.

The kanji for red ( 赤 ) is usually only fully formed when it is on the left, as in 赦 , so as a primitive, fully red on the left = _commie_. This kanji is unusual in that the commies (2 of them!) have moved over to the right and taken over this entire kanji. The little mouth on the left is protesting what can only be a pictoral representation of the **red menace**.;4) [[dingomick](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dingomick)] 9-4-2007(16): A father **upbraid** s his daughter for the _red_ lipstick and little _red_ dress. "You're not going out like that!".;5) [[fuaburisu](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/fuaburisu)] 15-1-2006(11): Kanji meanings : to reproach, to scold (note the _mouth_ to the left). This english word is unusual for me, as I thought it referred to braids. So to tie it all up together I imagine two women of the middle-age playing cards. One of them puts down _a pair of reds_ (the _red_ cards, to avoid the primitive _two_ , which is not the same). The other woman thinks she is cheating, and they start scolding each other (that is **upbraid** ing, with their _mouth_ ), and pulling each other's braids up.

It looks like these **item** s have been there forever. Asking the clerk if anything else is available, he doesn't understand and instead asks - "Two **item** s? Three **item** s?"

"No, " says the salesman, "you bought that **as is**!". _Mr T_ calmly steps out of the car, picks up the _exhaust_ , walks over to the salesman, and wraps the _exhaust_ pipe around his neck (causing his neck to _freeze_ from the cold).

脩;dried meat;;;1) [[Peppi](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Peppi)] 12-5-2009(26): Once again, _Mr. T_ ventured out into the remote area to visit his _old taskmaster_ (see [permanence/remote](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/958) (#958 悠)). However, the _old taskmaster_ has become very weak. His _flesh_ looks like **dried meat** and his heart almost stopped (no heart). He stayed a whole _month_ to take care about his former teacher.;2) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 23-4-2007(11): _Mr. T_ doesn't like **dried meat**. He's been known to take a _walking stick_ to the _taskmaster_ trying to hand him a piece of _meat_ that had been dried out. No, _Mr. T_ doesn't like **dried meat** a-t a-l-l!;3) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-6-2008(4): If you recall from [discipline](../v4/1722.html) (#1722 修), _Hitler_ was standing on top of _Ditto_ trying to discipline him (read: smacking him repeatedly with a _walking stick_ ) into being able to faithfully reproduce a likeness of _Mr T_. _Hitler_ keeps whacking and whacking, and whacking! He actually forgets to look down to see if _Ditto_ is handling this okay - and when he finally does, _Ditto_ has lost his flexibility and has turned into a small piece of **dried meat**. "Oh vell," thinks Hitler, "I vas hunkry anyvay.".;4) [[kapalama](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kapalama)] 28-10-2010(3): 束脩 [dried meat](../v4/2130.html) (#2130 脩) シュウ, おさむ … Parts: 修 -彡, 月 (cf: 悠 [permanence/remote](http://kanji.koohii.com/study/kanji/958) (#958 悠), 修 [discipline](../v4/1722.html) (#1722 修), 篠 [slender bamboo](../v4/2639.html) (#2639 篠) … Note: Usually the male name おさむ … Story: Historically the offering of **dried meat** ( 束脩 ) given by an apprentice to a master when coming for training.

倅;my son;;;1) [[CharleyGarrett](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CharleyGarrett)] 28-12-2006(43): " **My son** ", sniffs _Mr. T_ , "I'm so glad that you are now a college _graduate_ " he said.;2) [[Nuriko](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Nuriko)] 7-5-2011(11): Important note: Instead of the keyword "my son," the keyword "good for nothing son" may be more appropriate. This word is one of the examples of depreciating titles for family members. This word is used to refer to your son when you especially want to lower his status. So, keep that in mind when deciding on a story or when making your own. I suggest CountPacula's story, since it involves that "good for nothing son" meaning a little more.;3) [[CountPacula](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CountPacula)] 17-1-2009(9): I won't consider _that person_ to be **my son** until he actually manages to show he's capable of something and _graduates_!;4) [[sgrant](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/sgrant)] 30-4-2009(5): Only after _Luke Skywalker graduates_ as a fully-fledged jedi does Vader finally tell him the big secret - "I'm your father… you're **my son** ".;5) [[dihutenosa](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/dihutenosa)] 28-6-2008(2): My dad had a hard time picking me out of the crowd at my high school _graduation_ , so at my college _graduation_ , I taped a magazine cutout picture of _Mr T_ to my cap (we have both been fans of the _A-Team_ series since it came out). I didn't tell him, though, so as to surprise him. When I came out in the big line, I could hear my dad's love and surprise as he shouted - "hey, there, that young man in the _Mr T_ cap! That's **my son**!!!".
做;make do;;;1) [[Katsuo](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/Katsuo)] 10-12-2012(53): Note that the meaning of this (rare) kanji is " **make** (something) / **do** (something)", not "get by with". Story: _Mr. T_ doesn't rely on _happenstance_ , he **makes** things **do** what he wants. Edit: In fact three Japanese kanji dictionaries I checked all list 做 as an alternative to 作 [make](../v4/1142.html) (#1142 作), so " **make (alt)** " might be the best keyword. Story: _Mr. T_ by _happenstance_ found an **alt** ernative way to **make** things. (See also bennyb  & faneca's notes).;2) [[bennyb](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/bennyb)] 4-4-2010(7): (food for thought) I know this is RTK3 and all, but this kanji seems almost completely useless. The two most common phrases it's included in are 言い做す to speak as though something were actually the case and 見なす to regard (as equivalent). Both of which USUALLY just write なすin kana, and neither of which have anything to do with the meaning. In fact I can't find any trace of Katsuo's suggestion of this meaning. Anyone care to enlighten me? Perhaps this one's worth skipping.;3) [[ikmys](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/ikmys)] 17-4-2007(6): _Mr. T_ is an _old_ -school _taskmaster_. He **makes** all his little T's **do** their chores and **do** their homework before bed. "I ain't gonna let those kids slide!".;4) [[astridtops](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/astridtops)] 7-1-2007(6): A _person_ should try to make his own luck, but sometimes you have to **make do** with _happenstance_.;5) [[faneca](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/faneca)] 14-7-2012(4): @bennyb: As much as I usually love katsuo's contributions, I agree with you this time. For the sense you mention, I guess " **figuratively** " would be a better keyword. See [1]: [「見做す」](midori://search?text=「見做す」) "to regard [figuratively] as", [「思い做しか」](midori://search?text=「思い做しか」) "imagination (to think [figuratively])", etc. On the other hand, look at the Chinese compounds at [2]: it clearly means "make"/"do" ( 做爱 to make love, 做梦 to dream).

So imagine tracking a _T-Rex_ and marking a _heart_ on a chart, and shaking your head at the massive waste of life…;5) [[CasualTatsumaki](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/CasualTatsumaki)] 31-1-2011(1): **Without exception** , all the braves must find the _animal tracks_ then eat the raw _heart_ of the beast in order to become a man.

Note: Contrary to RTK3 2nd ed, a [ri](../v4/173.html) (#173 里) is about 2.5 times longer than a **mile**. See RTK1 for correct measure.

Note: [尺・しゃく](midori://search?text=尺・しゃく) is being combined with 口 in same way as [mile](../v4/2950.html) (#2950 哩) to signal analogy between _shaku_ and **feet**. 尺 is about 3ocm - slightly under a foot.;4) [[herman](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/herman)] 16-1-2009(4): This means **feet** in the sense of measurement.

" **Brah, man, just chill, man.** Braaaaah#." Apparently he's a surfer **brahman**. You ask him the meaning of life, and he smiles, and waits…waits…waits…until a bit of wind blows by.

"Whatever, dude…" He gets his license, and hands out _flowers_ to anyone who will take them.;3) [[abaddon](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/abaddon)] 12-6-2008(4): Flower, pinnacle, product: I didn't understand the terrorist: **bodhisattva** … body fatwa? Hmm.. just to be sure, I gave him the booby trap _flower_ (a _product_ of the _Pinnacle_ ). Later, I learned that **bodhisattva** is someone who postpones his or her own enlightenment to help others.

He raised his hand at the meeting and said, "I propose we call it the Ford **Ka**. No, not like 'car', the **Sanskrit ka** invokes a sense of reliability, safety, performance and beauty. _Add_ to that the fact that nobody will forget its name, because it's homophonous with the actual product!;3) [[kioku3](http://kanji.koohii.com/profile/kioku3)] 24-9-2009(4): If you want to buy a **Sanskrit ka** (the top selling auto in India), you need to _add_ a little bakeesh to the price for the salesman.
